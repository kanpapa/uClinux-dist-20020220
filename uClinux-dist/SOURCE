uClinux/distribution SOURCE
---------------------------

The sources in this build have come from many places.
Primarily from www.uclinux.org and cvs.uclinux.org


The directories:

linux    -- uClinux sources from cvs.uclinux.org
            FreeSWAN 1.8 from www.freeswan.org

lib      -- User application libraries. Includes libc, libm and others.
            libc is uC-libc from www.uclinux.org
            libm is uC-libm from www.uclinux.org

user     -- User mode applications, source from many places.
            Too many places to enumerate, many are standard GNU/Linux
            packages, all are freely available on the net somewhere.


The following directories hold results of the build process:

config   -- Basically a version of the linux config scripts that are
            used to drive the vendor/platform configuration.

vendors  -- holds plaform specific build information or support files.
            This is also the location where default build configurations
            are kept for each of the supported platforms.

romfs    -- Is the structrue of the ROM based file system. Mostly it
            holds the user application binaries, but also has device nodes.

images   -- Contains the final build binaries of the kernel, ROM file
            system, and the complete combined image.
