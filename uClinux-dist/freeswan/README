This is release 1.91 of Linux FreeS/WAN, our freely-redistributable IPsec
implementation.  See http://www.freeswan.org for current news and pointers
to more recent releases (if any).  The BUGS file lists bugs that we
consider major, and the CHANGES file lists the major things that have been
done since last time; READ BOTH before installing. 

The current development and target system for FreeS/WAN is Red Hat 6.2
with a 2.2.19 kernel, although we're in the process of moving to RH7.1
with 2.4.5; there is increasingly-limited support for RH5.2 with 2.0.39. 
We advise against use of older kernels.  It's likely to work with other
Linux distributions using 2.2.x or 2.4.x kernels; if modifications are
necessary, please tell us details, and we'll try to fix it so it'll drop
in cleanly in future.  Red Hat 7.0 badly messed up its compilers; this has
been fixed for 7.1.  Other systems are a lower priority but we'd still
like to hear details if you try it. 

Several high-level documents are in the doc directory.  Most are in HTML
format; do

	lynx doc/index.html

(or use your own favorite HTML reader) to read them.  See doc/README for
two methods of getting plain-text versions if needed.  See doc/roadmap.html
for a guide to what's where in this distribution. 

Unpacking the distribution needs about 10MB, and compiling it maybe
another 10MB.  For setup procedures, start at doc/intro.html; the INSTALL
file is now intended for experts only. 

Feedback is welcome, preferably (for legal reasons, among others) to the
users mailing list (see http://www.freeswan.org/mail.html to subscribe).
(Caution:  that mailing list goes all over the world.  If you are located
in the US, or are a US citizen, read doc/politics.html before sending
mail!)  If you're reporting a problem with the software, we ask that you
read doc/prob.report first.

COPYING.  Some parts of it are not; see CREDITS for the details.
