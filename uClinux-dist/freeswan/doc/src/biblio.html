  To conclusively demonstrate that DES is inadequate for continued use, the <a

  encryption in under five days on average, under nine in the worst case.</p>

  <p>The book provides details of their design and, perhaps even more
  important, discusses why they felt the project was necessary. Recommended
  for anyone interested in any of the three topics mentioned in the
  subtitle.</p>

  <a name="PGP"> Simson Garfinkel <cite>PGP: Pretty Good Privacy</cite><br>
  O'Reilly 1995 ISBN 1-56592-098-8<br>
  An excellent introduction and user manual for the </a><a href="glossary.html#PGP">PGP</a>
  email-encryption package.  PGP is a good package with a complex and
  poorly-designed user interface. This book or one like it is a must for
  anyone who has to use it at length.</p>

  <p>The book covers using PGP in Unix, PC and Macintosh environments, plus
  considerable background material on both the technical and political issues
  around cryptography. The only shortcoming is that it does not cover recent
  developments such as PGP 5 and Open PGP.

 even though it
  does not have much on computer cryptography.</a>

Government -- Saving Privacy in the Digital Age</cite></a><br>
Penguin 2001, ISBN 0-670--85950-8<br>
<strong>Highly recommended</strong>. A fine history of recent (about 1970-2000) developments in the
field, and the related political controversies. FreeS/WAN project
founder and leader John Gilmore appears several times.
<p>
The book does not cover IPSEC or FreeS/WAN, but this project is
very much another battle in the same war.  See our

  Probably <strong>the funniest technical book ever written</strong>, this is a vicious but
  well-reasoned attack on the OSI "seven layer model" and all that went with
  it. Several chapters of it are also available as RFCs 871 to 875.

  The best general treatment of computer-mediated communication we have seen.
  It naturally has much to say about the Internet, but also covers UUCP,
  Fidonet and so on.</a>

  <a name="ranch"> David Ranch <cite>Securing Linux Step by Step</cite><br>
  SANS Institute, 1999<br>
  </a><a href="http://www.sans.org/">SANS</a> is a respected organisation,
  this guide is part of a well-known series, and Ranch has previously written
  the useful <a
  href="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/TrinityOS.wri">Trinity
  OS</a> guide to securing Linux, so my guess would be this is a pretty good
  book. I haven't read it yet, so I'm not certain. It can be ordered online

<a name="secrets">Bruce Schneier <cite>Secrets and Lies</cite><br>
Wiley 2000, ISBN 0-471-25311-1<br>

An interesting discussion of security and privacy issues, written
with more of an &quot;executive overview&quot; approach rather than a
narrow focus on the technical issues. <strong>Highly recommended</strong>.
<hr>
<a name="VPNbook"> Scott, Wolfe and Irwin <cite>Virtual Private
  Networks</cite></a><br>
  2nd edition, O'Reilly 1999 ISBN: 1-56592-529-7<br>
  This is the only O'Reilly book, out of a dozen I own, that I'm disappointed
  with. It deals mainly with building VPNs with various proprietary tools
  -- <a href="glossary.html#PPTP">PPTP</a>, <a href="glossary.html#SSH">SSH</a>, Cisco PIX, ... --
  and touches only lightly on IPSEC-based approaches.</p>

  <p>That said, it appears to deal competently with what it does cover and it
  has readable explanations of many basic VPN and security concepts. It may be
  exactly what some readers require, even if I find the emphasis
  unfortunate.

  <a name="LASG">Kurt Seifried <cite>Linux Administrator's Security

<a name="neal">Neal Stephenson <cite>Cryptonomicon</cite></a><br>
Hardcover ISBN -380-97346-4, Avon, 1999.
<p>
A novel in which cryptography and the net figure prominently. <strong>Highly recommended</strong>:
I liked it enough I immediately went out and bought all the author's other books.
<p>
There is also a paperback edition. Sequels are expected.
