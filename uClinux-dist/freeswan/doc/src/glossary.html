  <p>
Entries are in alphabetical order. Some entries are only one line or one
paragraph long. Others run to several paragraphs. I have tried to put the
essential information in the first paragraph so you can skip the other
paragraphs if that seems appropriate.</p>

      <dd>Using three <a href="#DES">DES</a> encryptions on a single data
        block, with at least two different keys, to get higher security than
        is available from a single DES pass. The three-key version of 3DES is
        the default encryption algorithm for <a href="#FreeSWAN">Linux
        FreeS/WAN</a>.
        <p><a href="#IPSEC">IPSEC</a> always does 3DES with three different
        keys, as required by RFC 2451. For an explanation of the two-key
        variant, see <a href="#2key">two key triple DES</a>. Both use an <a
        href="#EDE">EDE</a> encrypt-decrypt-encrpyt sequence of
        operations.</p>
        <p>Single <a href="#DES">DES</a> is <a
        href="#desnotsecure">insecure</a>.</p>
        <p>Double DES is ineffective. Using two 56-bit keys, one might expect
        an attacker to have to do 2<sup>112</sup> work to break it. In fact,
        only 2<sup>57</sup> work is required with a <a
        href="#meet">meet-in-the-middle attack</a>, though a large amount of
        memory is also required. Triple DES is vulnerable to a similar attack,
        but that just reduces the work factor from the 2<sup>168</sup> one
        might expect to 2<sup>112</sup>. That provides adequate protection
        against <a href="#brute">brute force</a> attacks, and no better attack
        is known.</p>
        <p>3DES can be somewhat slow compared to other ciphers. It requires
        three DES encryptions per block. DES was designed for hardware
        implementation and includes some operations which are difficult in
        software. However, the speed we get is quite acceptable for many uses.
        See <a href="#benchmarks">benchmarks</a> below for details.</p>

        href="#passive">passive attack</a>) but takes action to change,
        delete, reroute, add, forge or divert data. Perhaps the best-known
        active attack is <a href="#middle">man-in-the-middle</a>. In general,
        <a href="#authentication">authentication</a> is a useful defense

      <dd>The <b>A</b>dvanced <b>E</b>ncryption <b>S</b>tandard, a new <a
        href="#block">block cipher</a> standard to replace <a
        href="#desnotsecure">DES</a> being developed by <a
        href="#NIST">NIST</a>, the US National Institute of Standards and
        Technology. DES used 64-bit blocks and a 56-bit key. AES ciphers use a
        128-bit block and are required to support 128, 192 and 256-bit keys.
        Some of them support other sizes as well. The larger block size helps
        resist <a href="#birthday">birthday attacks</a> while the large key
        size prevents <a href="#brute">brute force attacks</a>.
        <p>Fifteen proposals meeting NIST's basic criteria were submitted in
        1998 and subjected to intense discussion and analysis, "round one"
        evaluation. In August 1999, NIST narrowed the field to five "round
        two" candidates:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a
            href="http://www.research.ibm.com/security/mars.html">Mars</a>

            from the consulting firm Counterpane</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
In October 2000, NIST announced the winner -- Rijndael.</p>
        <p>Adding one or more AES ciphers to <a href="#FreeSWAN">Linux
        FreeS/WAN</a> would be useful undertaking, and considerable freely
        available code exists to start from. One complication is that our code
        is built for a 64-bit block cipher and AES uses a 128-bit block.

    <dt><a name="authentication">Authentication</a></dt>
      <dd>Ensuring that a message originated from the expected sender and has
        not been altered on route. <a href="#IPSEC">IPSEC</a> uses
        authentication in two places:
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li>peer authentication, authenticating the players in <a
            href="#IKE">IKE</a>'s <a href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman</a> key
            exchanges to prevent <a href="#middle">man-in-the-middle
            attacks</a>. This can be done in a number of ways. The methods
            supported by FreeS/WAN are discussed in our <a
            href="config.html#choose">configuration</a> document.</li>
          <li>packet authentication, authenticating packets on an established
            <a href="#SA">SA</a>, either with a separate <a
            href="#AH">authentication header</a> or with the optional
            authentication in the <a href="#ESP">ESP</a> protocol. In either
            case, packet authentication uses a <a href="#HMAC">hashed message
            athentication code</a> technique.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Outside IPSEC, passwords are perhaps the most common authentication
        mechanism. Their function is essentially to authenticate the person's
        identity to the system. Passwords are generally only as secure as the
        network they travel over. If you send a cleartext password over a
        tapped phone line or over a network with a packet sniffer on it, the
        security provided by that password becomes zero. Sending an encrypted
        password is no better; the attacker merely records it and reuses it at
        his convenience. This is called a <a href="#replay">replay</a>
        attack.</p>
        <p>A common solution to this problem is a <a
        href="#challenge">challenge-response</a> system. This defeats simple
        eavesdropping and replay attacks. Of course an attacker might still
        try to break the cryptographic algorithm used, or the
        <a href="#random">random number</a> generator.</p>
      </dd>
    <dt><a name="auto">Automatic keying</a></dt>
      <dd>A mode in which keys are automatically generated at connection
        establisment and new keys automaically created periodically
        thereafter. Contrast with <a href="#manual">manual keying</a> in which
        a single stored key is used.
        <p>IPSEC uses the <a href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman key exchange
        protocol</a> to create keys. An <a
        href="authentication">authentication</a> mechansim is required for
        this. The methods supported by FreeS/WAN are discussed in our <a
        href="#choose">configuration</a> document.</p>
        <p>Having an attacker break the authentication is emphatically not a
        good idea. An attacker that breaks authentication, and manages to
        subvert some other network entities (DNS, routers or gateways), can
        use a <a href="#middle">man-in-the middle attack</a> to break the
        security of your IPSEC connections.</p>
        <p>However, having an attacker break the authentication in automatic
        keying is not quite as bad as losing the key in manual keying.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An attacker who reads /etc/ipsec.conf and gets the keys for a
            manually keyed connection can, without further effort, read all
            messages encrypted with those keys, including any old messages he
            may have archived.</li>
          <li>Automatic keying has a property called <a href="#PFS">perfect
            forward secrecy</a>. An attacker who breaks the authentication
            gets none of the automatically generated keys and cannot
            immediately read any messages. He has to mount a successful <a
            href="#middle">man-in-the-middle attack</a> in real time before he
            can read anything. He cannot read old archived messages at all and
            will not be able to read any future messages not caught by
            man-in-the-middle tricks.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That said, the secrets used for authentication, stored in <a
        href="manpage.d/ipsec.secrets.5.html">ipsec.secrets(5)</a>, should
        still be protected as tightly as cryptographic keys.</p>

    <dt><a name="birthday">Birthday attack</a></dt>
      <dd>A cryptographic attack based on the mathematics exemplified by the
        <a href="#paradox">birthday paradox</a>. This math turns up whenever
        the question of two cryptographic operations producing the same result
        becomes an issue:

          <li>hash algorithms such as <a href="#SHA">SHA</a> and <a
            href="#RIPEMD">RIPEMD-160</a> giving a 160-bit result rather than

      <dd>Not really a paradox, just a rather counter-intuitive mathematical
        fact. In a group of 23 people, the chance of a least one pair having
        the same birthday is over 50%.
        <p>The second person has 1 chance in 365 (ignoring leap years) of
        matching the first. If they don't match, the third person's chances of

        <p><a href="#DES">DES</a> is among the the best known and widely used
        block ciphers, but is now obsolete. Its 56-bit key size makes it <a

        href="#desnotsecure">insecurity of DES</a> with its 56-bit key. For an
        analysis of key sizes required to resist plausible brute force
        attacks, see <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/keylength.html">this
        paper</a>.
        <p>Longer keys protect against brute force attacks. Each extra bit in
        the key doubles the number of possible keys and therefore doubles the
        work a brute force attack must do. A large enough key defeats
        <strong>any</strong> brute force attack.</p>
        <p>For example, the EFF's <a href="#EFF">DES Cracker</a> searches a
        56-bit key space in an average of a few days. Let us assume an
        attacker that can find a 64-bit key (256 times harder) by brute force
        search in a second (a few hundred thousand times faster). For a 96-bit
        key, that attacker needs 2<sup>32</sup> seconds, just over a century.
        Against a 128-bit key, he needs 2<sup>32</sup> centuries or about
        400,000,000,000 years. Your data is then obviously secure against
        brute force attacks. Even if our estimate of the attacker's speed is
        off by a factor of a million, it still takes him 400,000 years to
        crack a message.</p>
        <p>This is why</p>
        <ul>
          <li>single <a href="#DES">DES</a> is now considered <a
            href="#desnotsecure">dangerously insecure</a></li>
          <li>all of the current generation of <a href="#block">block
            ciphers</a> use a 128-bit or longer key</li>
          <li><a href="#AES">AES</a> ciphers support keysizes 128, 192 and 256
            bits</li>
          <li>any cipher we add to Linux FreeS/WAN will have <em>at least</em>
            a 128-bit key</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Cautions:</strong><br>
        <em>Inadequate keylength always indicates a weak cipher</em> but it is
        important to note that <em>adequate keylength does not necessarily
        indicate a strong cipher</em>. There are many attacks other than brute
        force, and adequate keylength <em>only</em> guarantees resistance to
        brute force. Any cipher, whatever its key size, will be weak if design
        or implementation flaws allow other attacks.</p>
        <p>Also, <em>once you have adequate keylength</em> (somewhere around
        90 or 100 bits), <em>adding more key bits make no practical
        difference</em>, even against brute force. Consider our 128-bit
        example above that takes 400 billion years to break by brute force. Do
        we care if an extra 16 bits of key put that into the quadrillions? No.
        What about 16 fewer bits reducing it to the 112-bit security level of
        <a href="#3DES">Triple DES</a>, which our example attacker could break
        in just over a billion years? No again, unless we're being really
        paranoid about safety margins.</p>
        <p>There may be reasons of convenience in the design of the cipher to
        support larger keys. For example <a href="#Blowfish">Blowfish</a>
        allows up to 448 bits and <a href="#RC4">RC4</a> up to 2048, but
        beyond 100-odd bits it makes no difference to practical security.</p>

        <p>This is more secure than passwords against two simple attacks:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>If cleartext passwords are sent across the wire (e.g. for
            telnet), an eavesdropper can grab them. The attacker may even be
            able to break into other systems if the user has chosen the same
            password for them.</li>
          <li>If an encrypted password is sent, an attacker can record the

          attack.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A challenge-response system never sends a password, either
        cleartext or encrypted.  An attacker cannot record the response to one
        challenge and use it as a response to a later challenge. The random

            clients of that office's IPSEC gateway. Laptop or home machines
            connecting to the office, however, are <em>not</em> clients of
            that gateway. They are remote gateways, running the other end of
            an IPSEC connection. Each of them is also its own client.</li>
          <li><strong>IPSEC client software</strong> is used to describe

    <dt><a name="DOS">Denial of service (DoS) attack</a></dt>
      <dd>An attack that aims at denying some service to legitimate users of a
        system, rather than providing a service to the attacker.
        <ul>
          <li>One variant is a flooding attack, overwhelming the system with
            too many packets, to much email, or whatever.</li>
          <li>A closely related variant is a resource exhaustion attack. For
            example, consider a "TCP SYN flood" attack. Setting up a TCP
            connection involves a three-packet exchange:
            <ul>
              <li>Initiator: Connection please (SYN)</li>
              <li>Responder: OK (ACK)</li>
              <li>Initiator: OK here too</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If the attacker puts bogus source information in the first
            packet, such that the second is never delivered, the responder may
            wait a long time for the third to come back. If responder has
            already allocated memory for the connection data structures, and
            if many of these bogus packets arrive, the responder may run out
            of memory.</p>
          </li>
          <li>Another variant is to feed the system undigestible data, hoping
            to make it sick. For example, IP packets are limited in size to
            64K bytes and a fragment carries information on where it starts
            within that 64K and how long it is. The "ping of death" delivers
            fragments that say, for example, that they start at 60K and are
            20K long. Attempting to re-assemble these without checking for
            overflow can be fatal.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The two example attacks discussed were both quite effective when
        first discovered, capable of crashing or disabling many operating
        systems. They were also well-publicised, and today far fewer systems
        are vulnerable to them.</p>

      <dd>The problem of finding logarithms in a finite field. Given a field
        defintion (such definitions always include some operation analogous to
        multiplication) and two numbers, a base and a target, find the power
        which the base must be raised to in order to yield the target.
        <p>The discrete log problem is the basis of several cryptographic
        systems, including the <a href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman</a> key exchange
        used in the <a href="#IKE">IKE</a> protocol. The useful property is
        that exponentiation is relatively easy but the inverse operation,
        finding the logarithm, is hard. The cryptosystems are designed so that
        the user does only easy operations (exponentiation in the field) but
        an attacker must solve the hard problem (discrete log) to crack the
        system.</p>
        <p>There are several variants of the problem for different types of

        href="biblio.html#handbook">Handbook of Applied Cryptography</a>.</p>
        <p>Given a prime <var>p</var>, a generator <var>g</var> for the field
        modulo that prime, and a number <var>x</var> in the field, the problem
        is to find <var>y</var> such that <var>g^y = x</var>.</p>
        <p>For example, let p = 13. The field is then the integers from 0 to
        12. Any integer equals one of these modulo 13. That is, the remainder
        when any integer is divided by 13 must be one of these.</p>
        <p>2 is a generator for this field.  That is, the powers of two modulo
        13 run through all the non-zero numbers in the field. Modulo 13 we
        have:</p>
        <pre>          y      x
        2^0  ==  1
        2^1  ==  2
        2^2  ==  4
        2^3  ==  8
        2^4  ==  3 that is, the remainder from 16/13 is 3
        2^5  ==  6          the remainder from 32/13 is 6
        2^6  == 12 and so on
        2^7  == 11
        2^8  ==  9
        2^9  ==  5
        2^10 == 10
        2^11 ==  7
        2^12 ==  1</pre>
        <p>
Exponentiation in such a field is not difficult. Given, say,
<nobr><var>y = 11</var>,</nobr> calculating <nobr><var>x = 7</var></nobr> is straightforward.
One method is just to calculate <nobr><var>2^11 = 2048</var>,</nobr> then
<nobr><var>2048 mod 13 == 7</var>.</nobr> 
When the field is modulo a large prime (say a few 100 digits) you need a silghtly cleverer
method and even that is moderately expensive in computer time, but the calculation is still not
        problematic in any basic way.</p>
        <p>
The discrete log problem is the reverse. In our example, given
<nobr><var>x = 7</var>,</nobr> find the logarithm <nobr><var>y = 11</var>.</nobr> 
 When the
        field is modulo a large prime (or is based on a suitable elliptic
        curve), this is indeed problematic. No solution method that is not
        catastrophically expensive is known. Quite a few mathematicians have
        tackled this problem. No efficient method has been found and mathematicians
        do not expect that one will be. It seems likely no efficient solution
        to either of the main variants the discrete log problem exists.</p>
        <p>Note, however, that no-one has proven such methods do not exist. If
        a solution to either variant were found, the security of any crypto
        system using that variant would be destroyed.  This is one reason
        <a href="#IKE">IKE</a> supports two variants. If one is broken, we can
        switch to the other.</p>

      <dd>A situation in which something IP sees as one network is actually in

        <p>For example, the Internet may route all traffic for a particular

        treat a branch office like a subnet, giving it IP addresses "on" their
        corporate net. This becomes an extruded subnet.</p>
        <p>Packets bound for it are delivered to the corporate gateway, since
        as far as the outside world is concerned, that subnet is part of the
        corporate network. However, instead of going onto the corporate LAN
        (as they would for, say, the accounting department) they are then
        encapsulated and sent back onto the Internet for delivery to the
        branch office.</p>

      <dd>An <a href="#active">active attack</a> in which the attacker
        impersonates each of the legitimate players in a protocol to the
        other.
        <p>For example, if <a href="#alicebob">Alice and Bob</a> are
        negotiating a key via the <a href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman</a> key
        agreement, and are not using <a
        href="#authentication">authentication</a> to be certain they are
        talking to each other, then an attacker able to insert himself in the
        communication path can deceive both players.</p>
        <p>Call the attacker Mallory. For Bob, he pretends to be Alice. For
        Alice, he pretends to be Bob. Two keys are then negotiated,
        Alice-to-Mallory and Bob-to-Mallory. Alice and Bob each think the key
        they have is Alice-to-Bob.</p>
        <p>A message from Alice to Bob then goes to Mallory who decrypts it,
        reads it and/or saves a copy, re-encrypts using the Bob-to-Mallory key
        and sends it along to Bob. Bob decrypts successfully and sends a reply
        which Mallory decrypts, reads, re-encrypts and forwards to Alice.</p>
        <p>To make this attack effective, Mallory must</p>
        <ul>
          <li>subvert some part of the network in some way that lets him carry
            out the deception<br>
            possible targets: DNS, router, Alice or Bob's machine, mail
            server, ...</li>
          <li>beat any authentication mechanism Alice and Bob use<br>
            strong authentication defeats the attack entirely; this is why <a
            href="#IKE">IKE</a> requires authentication</li>
          <li>work in real time, delivering messages without introducing

            not hard if Alice and Bob are using email; quite difficult in some
            situations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If he manages it, however, it is devastating. He not only gets to
        read all the messages; he can alter messages, inject his own, forge
        anything he likes, . . . In fact, he controls the communication

    <dt><a name="meet">Meet-in-the-middle attack</a></dt>
      <dd>A divide-and-conquer attack which breaks a cipher into two parts,
        works against each separately, and compares results. Probably the best
        known example is an attack on double DES. This applies in principle to
        any pair of block ciphers, e.g. to an encryption system using, say,
        CAST-128 and Blowfish, but we will describe it for double DES.
        <p>Double DES encryption and decryption can be written:</p>
        <pre>        C = E(k2,E(k1,P))
        P = D(k1,D(k2,C))</pre>
        <p>Where C is ciphertext, P is plaintext, E is encryption, D is
        decryption, k1 is one key, and k2 is the other key. If we know a P, C
        pair, we can try and find the keys with a brute force attack, trying
        all possible k1, k2 pairs. Since each key is 56 bits, there are
        2<sup>112</sup> such pairs and this attack is painfully
        inefficient.</p>
        <p>The meet-in-the middle attack re-writes the equations to calculate
        a middle value M:</p>
        <pre>        M = E(k1,P)
        M = D(k2,C)</pre>
        <p>Now we can try some large number of D(k2,C) decryptions with
        various values of k2 and store the results in a table. Then start
        doing E(k1,P) encryptions, checking each result to see if it is in the
        table.</p>
        <p>With enough table space, this breaks double DES with 2<sup>57</sup>
        work. The memory requirements of such attacks can be prohibitive, but
        there is a whole body of research literature on methods of reducing
        them.</p>

    <dt><a name="digest">Message Digest Algorithm</a></dt>
      <dd>An algorithm which takes a message as input and produces a hash or
        digest of it, a fixed-length set of bits which depend on the message
        contents in some highly complex manner. Design criteria include making
        it extremely difficult for anyone to counterfeit a digest or to change
        a message without altering its digest. One essential property is <a
        href="#collision">collision resistance</a>. The main applications are

      <dd><strong>M</strong>aximum <strong>T</strong>ransmission
        <strong>U</strong>nit, the largest size of packet that can be sent
        over a link. This is determined by the underlying network, but must be
        taken account of at the IP level.
        <p>IP packets, which can be up to 64K bytes each, must be packaged
        into lower-level packets of the appropriate size for the underlying
        network(s) and re-assembled on the other end. When a packet must pass
        over multiple networks, each with its own MTU, and many of the MTUs
        are unknown to the sender, this becomes a fairly complex problem. See
        <a href="#pathMTU">path MTU discovery</a> for details.</p>
        <p>Often the MTU is a few hundred bytes on serial links and 1500
        on Ethernet. There are, however, serial link protocols which use a
        larger MTU to avoid fragmentation at the ethernet/serial
        boundary, and newer (especially gigabit) Ethernet networks sometimes
        support much larger packets because these are more efficient in some
        applications.</p>

        <p>Almost invariably, the phrase "non-routable address" means one of

          <li>172.x.anything with 16 &lt;= x &lt;= 31</li>
          <li>192.168.anything</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These addresses are commonly used on private networks, e.g. behind
        a Linux machines doing <a href="#masq">IP masquerade</a>. Machines
        within the private network can address each other with these
        addresses. All packets going outside that network, however, have these
        addresses replaced before they reach the Internet.</p>
        <p>If any packets using these addresses do leak out, they do not go
        far. Most routers automatically discard all such packets.</p>
        <p>Various other addresses -- the 127.0.0.0/8 block reserved for local
        use, 0.0.0.0, various broadcast and network addresses -- cannot be
        routed over the Internet, but are not normally included in the meaning

          <li>absolutely <a href="#random">random</a></li>
          <li>never re-used</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Given those three conditions, it can easily be proved that the
        cipher is perfectly secure, in the sense that an attacker with
        intercepted message in hand has no better chance of guessing the
        message than an attacker who has nt interecepted the message and only
        knows the message length. No such proof exists for any other
        cipher.</p>
        <p>There are, however, several problems with this "perfect"
        cipher.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is wildly impractical for many applications. Key management
            is difficult or impossible.</li>
          <li>It is <em>extremely</em> fragile. Small changes which violate
            the conditions listed above do not just weaken the cipher a bit;
            quite often they destroy its security completely.
            <ul>
              <li>Re-using the pad weakens it to the point where it can be
                broken with pencil and paper. With a computer, the attack is
                trivially easy.</li>
              <li>Using computer-generated pseudo-random numbers instead of a
                really <a href="#random">random</a> pad completely invalidates
                the security proof. Depending on random number generator used,
                this may also give an extremely weak cipher.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>If an attacker knows the plaintext and has an intercepted
            message, he can discover the pad. This does not matter if the
            attacker is just a <a href="#passive">passive</a> eavesdropper. It
            gives him no plaintext he didn't already know and we don't care
            that he learns a pad which we'll never re-use. However, knowing
            the pad lets an <a href="#active">active</a> attacker perform a <a

      <dd>The process of discovering the largest packet size which all links
        on a path can handle without fragmentation -- that is, without any
        router having to break the packet up into smaller pieces to match the
        <a href="#MTU">MTU</a> of its outgoing link.
        <p>This is done as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>originator sends the largest packets allowed by <a
            href="#MTU">MTU</a> of the first link, setting the DF
            (<strong>d</strong>on't <strong>f</strong>ragment) bit in the
            packet header</li>
          <li>any router which cannot send the packet on (outgoing MTU is too
            small for it, and DF prevents fragmenting it to match) sends back
            an <a href="#ICMP">ICMP</a> packet reporting the problem</li>
          <li>originator looks at ICMP message and tries a smaller size</li>
          <li>eventually, you settle on a size that can pass all routers</li>
          <li>thereafter, originator just sends that size and no-one has to
            fragment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since this requires co-operation of many systems, and since the
        next packet may travel a different path, this is one of the trickier
        areas of IP programming. Bugs that have shown up over the years have
        included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>malformed ICMP messages</li>
          <li>hosts that ignore or mishandle these ICMP messages</li>
          <li>firewalls blocking the ICMP messages so host does not see
          them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since IPSEC adds a header, it increases packet size and may require

      <dd><b>R</b>ivest <b>S</b>hamir <b>A</b>dleman public key encryption
        method, named for its three inventors. The algorithm is widely used
        and likely to become moreso since it became free of patent
        encumbrances in September 2000.
<p>
For a full explanation of the algorithm, consult one of the standard references
such as <a href="biblio.html#schneier">Applied Cryptography</a>. A simple
explanation is:
<p>
The great 17th century French mathematician
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Fermat.html">Fermat</a>
proved that, for any prime p and number x, 0 <= x < p:
<pre>
	x^p == x		modulo p
	x^(p-1) == 1		modulo p, non-zero x
</pre>
From this it follows that if we have a pair of primes p, q and two numbers e, d such that:
<pre>
	ed == 1			modulo lcm( p-1, q-1)
</pre>
where lcm() is least common multiple, then for all x, 0 <= x < pq:
<pre>
	x^(ed-1) == 1		modulo pq, non-zero x
	x^ed == x		modulo pq
</pre>
So we construct such as set of numbers p, q, e, d and publish the product N=pq and
e as the public key. Encryption is then:
<pre>
	c = x^e			modulo N
</pre>
An attacker cannot deduce x from the cyphertext c, short of either factoring N
or solving the <a href="#dlog">discrete logarithm</a> problem for this field.
If p, q are large primes (hundreds or thousands of bits) no efficient solution
to either problem is known.
<p>
The receiver, knowing the private key (N and d), can readily find x sixce:
<pre>
	c^d == (x^e)^d		modulo N
	    == x^ed		modulo N
	    == x		modulo N
</pre>
This gives an effective public key technique, with only a couple of problems.
It uses a good deal of computer time, since calculations with large integers
are not cheap, and there is no proof it is necessarily secure since no-one
has proven either factoring or discrete log cannot be done efficiently.

      <dd>A group of IP addresses which are logically one network, typically

        The range of addresses in a subnet is described using a subnet mask.
        See next entry.</dd>
    <dt>subnet mask</dt>
      <dd>A method of indicating the addresses included in a subnet. Here are
        two equivalent examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>101.101.101.0/24</li>
          <li>101.101.101.0 with mask 255.255.255.0</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The '24' is shorthand for a mask with the top 24 bits one and the
        rest zero. This is exactly the same as 255.255.255.0 which has three
        all-ones bytes and one all-zeros byte.</p>
        <p>These indicate that, for this range of addresses, the top 24 bits
        are to be treated as naming a network (often referred to as "the
        101.101.101.0/24 subnet") while most combinations of the low 8 bits
        can be used to designate machines on that network. Two addresses are
        reserved; 101.101.101.0 refers to the subnet rather than a specific
        machine while 101.101.101.255 is a broadcast address. 1 to 254 are
        available for machines.</p>
        <p>It is common to find subnets arranged in a hierarchy. For example,
        a large company might have a /16 subnet and allocate /24 subnets
        within that to departments. An ISP might have a large subnet and
        allocate /26 subnets (64 addresses, 62 usable) to business customers
        and /29 subnets (8 addresses, 6 usable) to residential clients.</p>

    <dt><a name="symmetric">Symmetric cryptography</a></dt>
      <dd>Symmetric cryptography, also referred to as conventional or secret
        key cryptography, relies on a <em>shared secret key</em>, identical
        for sender and receiver. Sender encrypts with that key, receiver
        decrypts with it. The idea is that an eavesdropper without the key be
        unable to read the messages. There are two main types of symmetric
        cipher, <a href="#block">block ciphers</a> and <a
        href="#stream">stream ciphers</a>.
        <p>Symmetric cryptography contrasts with <a href="#public">public
        key</a> or asymmetric systems where the two players use different
        keys.</p>
        <p>The great difficulty in symmetric cryptography is, of course, key
        management. Sender and receiver <em>must</em> have identical keys and
        those keys <em>must</em> be kept secret from everyone else. Not too
        much of a problem if only two people are involved and they can
        conveniently meet privately or employ a trusted courier. Quite a
        problem, though, in other circumstances.</p>
        <p>It gets much worse if there are many people. An application might
        be written to use only one key for communication among 100 people, for
        example, but there would be serious problems. Do you actually trust
        all of them that much? Do they trust each other that much? Should
        they? What is at risk if that key is compromised? How are you  going
        to distribute that key to everyone without risking its secrecy? What
        do you do when one of them leaves the company? Will you even know?</p>
        <p>On the other hand, if you need unique keys for every possible
        connection between a group of 100, then each user must have 99 keys.
        You need either 99*100/2 = 4950 <em>secure</em> key exchanges between
        users or a central authority that <em>securely</em> distributes 100
        key packets, each with a different set of 99 keys.</p>
        <p>Either of these is possible, though tricky, for 100 users. Either
        becomes an administrative nightmare for larger numbers. Moreover, keys
        <em>must</em> be changed regularly, so the problem of key distribution
        comes up again and again. If you use the same key for many messages
        then an attacker has more text to work with in an attempt to crack
        that key. Moreover, one successful crack will give him or her the text
        of all those messages.</p>
        <p>In short, the <em>hardest part of conventional cryptography is key
        management</em>. Today the standard solution is to build a <a
        href="#hybrid">hybrid system</a> using <a href="#public">public
        key</a> techniques to manage keys.</p>
