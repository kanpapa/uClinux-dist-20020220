<h1><a name="install">Installing FreeS/WAN</a></h1>

<h2><a name="who.install">Who needs to perform an installation?</a></h2>
<p>
Some Linux distributions, <a href="intro.html#distwith">listed in the
introduction</a>, ship with FreeS/WAN included. If you are using one of them,
you need not perform a FreeS/WAN installation. That should all be done for you
already. All you have to do is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>include FreeS/WAN in your installation choices, or add it to your
    configuration later</li>
  <li>if you install kernel source, be sure to use a version which includes
    the FreeS/WAN patches. This should be available from your CDs or from the
    web site for your distribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>Users of such distributions can skip ahead to our section on
<a href="config.html">setting up</a> FreeS/WAN.</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, due to <a href="politics.html#exlaw">export laws</a> restricting
distribution of strong cryptography, not all distributions include FreeS/WAN.
Moreover, the standard kernel does not include the kernel parts of FreeS/WAN.
Many people will need to install FreeS/WAN, including patching and rebuilding
their kernel.</p>

<h2><a name="re-install">Re-installs</a></h2>

If this is the first FreeS/WAN install on this machine, skip this section.
<p>
The scripts are designed so that a re-install -- to upgrade to a later
FreeS/WAN version or to a later kernel version -- can be done in exactly the
same way as an original install.
<p>
The scripts know enough, for example, not to apply the same kernel patch twice
and not to overwrite your <var>ipsec.conf</var> or <var>ipsec.secrets</var> files.
However, they will overwrite the _updown script. If you have modified that, save
your version under another name before doing the install.
<p>
Also, they may not always work exactly as designed. Check the <a href="../BUGS">BUGS</a>
file for any caveats in the current version. 

<dl>
<dt>to install a new version of FreeS/WAN, with your current kernel<dd>
Download and untar the new FreeS/WAN. Since kernel source has already
been installed and configured, you can skip a few steps in the procedure
below. Go to <a href="#building">Building FreeS/WAN</a>, and follow normal
FreeS/WAN procedures from there.
<dt>to install a new kernel, on a machine which already has FreeS/WAN installed<dd>
Download and untar the new kernel source. Since this kernel is not yet
configured, that is the next thing to do.Go to 
<a href="#kconfig">Kernel configuration</a>, and follow normal
FreeS/WAN procedures from there.
<dt>to upgrade both kernel and FreeS/WAN<dd>
You need both new kernel source and new FreeS/WAN source. Follow the full
FreeS/WAN install procedure.
</dl>

<h2><a name="before">Before starting the install</a></h2>

<p>Configure, compile, install, and test a Linux kernel, without
FreeS/WAN.</p>

<p>
If you have not done this before, you will need to read the
<a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel HowTo</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="choosek">Choosing a kernel</a></h3>

<h4><a name="2.2">2.2.19 for many users</a></h4>

<p>
Many users can continue to run kernels from the 2.2 series of
Linux production <a href="glossary.html#kernel">kernels</a>.
<p>
At time of writing (June 2001), the latest version is 2.2.19. If you
are going to use a 2.2 kernel, we <strong>strongly recommend
2.2.19</strong> since:
<ul>
<li>It has a number of small security fixes not found in earlier kernels.
<li>There have been changes in some kernel file formats that make it
difficult to compile a current FreeS/WAN with earlier kernels.
</ul>
If you really need to use an older 2.2.x kernel for some reason, see the
note in the FreeS/WAN 1.91 release <a href="../CHANGES">CHANGES</a>
file for a workaround for the compile difficulty, and the 
<a href="mail.html">mailing list archives</a> for more details if needed.

<h4><a name="2.4">2.4.x is possible</a></h4>

The new 2.4 series of kernels began in January 2001 and are currently
(early June) at 2.4.5. FreeS/WAN is known to work on 2.4.5.
<p>
2.4 has new firewalling code called
<a href="http://netfilter.kernelnotes.org/unreliable-guides/index.html">netfilter</a>.
This may provide good reasons to move to 2.4, especially on for gateway machines.

<h4><a name="2.0">2.0.x should still work</a></h4>

<p>
In the older 2.0.x kernel series, we no longer support versions earlier
than 2.0.38. 2.0.38 has fixes for a number of small security-related glitches,
worth having on a security gateway machine. FreeS/WAN has been tested on 2.0.39,
and does work there.</p>

<p>
Recent versions of FreeS/WAN are not heavily tested on 2.0 kernels. Most of
both the development team and the user community are on 2.2, or even 2.4,
by now.</p>
<p>
We are likely to drop 2.0 support entirely if some problem crops up that would
mean retaining it required significant work from our team.

<h4><a name="devkernel">Development kernels</a></h4>

Development kernels are a separate series, work-in-progress versions for use
by kernel developers. By convention, production kernels have an even second digit
in the version number (2.0, 2.2, 2.4) and development kernels have an odd
digit there (2.1, 2.3, 2.5).
<p>
At time of writing, no more 2.3
kernels are being produced and the 2.5 series has not been started yet, so just
now development kernels are not an issue. No doubt a 2.5 series will be started
in the next few months.
<p>
<strong>Development kernels are not intended for production use</strong>. They
change often and include new code which has not yet been thoroughly tested.
<strong>This regularly breaks things, including FreeS/WAN</strong>. The FreeS/WAN
team does not have the resources to chase the moving target; our priority is
developing FreeS/WAN on stable kernels. If you encounter a problem on a development
kernel, please solve it (you are a developer, aren't you?) and send us a patch.
Of course, we will happily discuss problems and solutions on the
<a href="mail.html">mailing list</a>, but we are unlikely to do much work on
actually implementing a solution. 
<p>
Fortunately we have a user who regularly fixes problems with FreeS/WAN on
development kernels (merci, Marc), and we do fix some ourselves. FreeS/WAN often works
just fine on a development kernel; it's just that there's no guarantee.
<p>
If you are going to test FreeS/WAN with a development kernel, we recommend you
<strong>use our latest snapshot</strong>. This is the FreeS/WAN version most likely
to have the patches required to work on a recent development kernel. The released
version of FreeS/WAN is likely to be out of date for your purposes.</p>

<h3><a name="getkernel">Things you must have installed</a></h3>

<p>
If you have a CD distribution of Linux, it should include everything you need.

<h4><a name="tool.lib"">Tools and libraries</h4>

Use your distribution's tools to load:</p>
<ul>
  <li>tools
  <ul>
    <li>a GNU C compiler (gcc or egcs)</li>
    <li>assembler and linker for your architecture (the bin86 package on PCs)</li>
    <li>miscellaneous development tools such as make(1) and patch(1)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>libraries, both headers and object modules
  <ul>
    <li>standard compiler libraries such as glibc</li>
    <li>the GMP (<strong>G</strong>NU <strong>M</strong>ulti-<strong>P</strong>recision) library, required for Pluto's public
      key calculations.
    <li>ncurses library if you want to use menuconfig (recommended)</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>
There are some <strong>common slips</strong> worth avoiding here:
<ul>
<li>not installing the GMP library. Pluto will not compile without it.
See the FreeS/WAN FAQ for <a href="faq.html#gmp.h_missing">more detail</a> if required.
<li>not installing patch(1). Our scripts need it to apply our patches to the
kernel.
</ul>

<h4><a name="kernel.">Kernel source code</a></h4>

You need the source code for the kernel because you must patch and re-compile it
to install FreeS/WAN. There are several places you can get this:
<ul>
<li>off your distribution CDs
<li>from your ditribution vendor's website
<li>from kernel.org
</ul>

<h5><a name="kernel.cd">Kernel from CD</a></h5>

You can install the kernel from your distribution CD. It may be in two packages.
  <ul> 
    <li>kernel source</li>
    <li>kernel headers</li>
  </ul>
However, if your CD is not recent, it may have an older kernel, in which case we
suggest getting more recent kernel source from the net.</p>

<h5>Vendor kernels</h5>
<p>
All the major distribution vendors provide kernel source. See for example:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Red Hat's list of <a href="http://www.redhat.com/mirrors.html">mirror
    sites</a></li>
  <li>SuSE's <a href="http://www.suse.com/us/support/download/index.html">download page</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
Using a kernel from your distribution vendor may save you some annoyance
later.</p>

<p>
Different distributions put the kernel in different places (/vmlinuz,
    /boot/vmlinuz, /boot/vmlinuz-2.2.15 ...) and set lilo (the
    <strong>Li</strong>nux <strong>lo</strong>ader) up differently. With a
    kernel from your distribution vendor, everything should work right. With
    other combinations, a newly compiled kernel may be installed in one place
    while lilo is looking in another. You can of course adjust the kernel
    Makefile and/or /etc/lilo.conf to solve this problem, but we suggest just
    avoiding it.</p>
<p>
Also, distributions vendors may include patches or drivers which are not
    part of the standard kernel. If you install a standard kernel, you must
    either do without those features or download those patches and add them
    yourself.</p>

<h5>Kernels from kernel.org</h5>

For kernels direct from Linus, without any distribution vendor's
modifications, see the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/">kernel.org</a>
mirror list, or go directly to <nobr><var>ftp.&lt;country&gt;.kernel.org</var>,</nobr>
with the appropriate two-letter country code inserted.</p>

<h4>Once you've found a kernel</h4>

<p>
Once you have found suitable kernel source, choose a mirror that is close to
you and bookmark it.</p>
<p>
Kernel source normally resides in <var>/usr/src/linux</var>, whether you load it from
a distribution CD or download a tar file into <var>/usr/src</var> and untar it there.
Unless you both have unusual requirements and know exactly what you're doing,
we recommend you put it there.</p>

<h3>Getting FreeS/WAN</h3>

<p>
You can download FreeS/WAN from our
<a href="ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/pub/crypto/freeswan/">primary site</a> or
one of our <a href="intro.html#sites">mirrors</a>.

<p>
Put the tarfile under <var>/usr/src</var> and untar it there. The command
to use is:
<ul>
<li>tar -xzf freeswan*.gz
</ul>
<p>
This will
give you a directory <var>/usr/src/freeswan&lt;version&gt;</var>.</p>

<p>Note that <strong>these methods don't work:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>putting freeswan under <var>/usr/src/linux</var>. The links become confused.</li>
  <li>untarring in one place, then using <var>cp -R</var> to move it where you want
    it. Some necessary symbolic links are not copied.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="kconfig">Kernel configuration</a></h3>

<p>
The gateway kernel must be configured before FreeS/WAN is added because
some of our utilities rely on the results of configuration.
<p>
<strong>Note for Redhat 7.1 users</strong>: If you are using the Redhat-supplied kernel,
then you <strong>must do a <nobr><var>make mrproper</var></nobr></strong>
command before starting the kernel configuration. This prevents some
unpleasant interactions between Redhat's config and our patches.
<p>
On some distributions, you can get the configuration files for the vendor's
standard kernel(s) off the CD, and use that. This allows you to skip this
step; you need not configure the kernel if the vendor has <em>and you have
the vendor's config file installed</em>. Here is a mailing list message 
describing the procedure for Redhat:
<pre>
Subject: Re: [Users] Do I need to recompile kernel 2.2.17-14?
   Date: Wed, 6 Jun 2001 08:38:38 -0500
   From: "Corey J. Steele" &lt;csteele@mtron.com&gt;

if you install the corresponding kernel-source-*.rpm, you can actually find
the config file used to build that kernel in /usr/src/linux/Configs, just
copy the one you want to use (based solely on architecture) to
/usr/src/linux/.config, and proceed!  It should work.
</pre>
If you have ever configured the kernel yourself on this machine, you can
also skip this step.
<p>
If the kernel has not been configured, do that now. This is done by giving
one of the following commands in <var>/usr/src/linux</var>:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>make config</dt>
    <dd>command-line interface</dd>
  <dt>make menuconfig</dt>
    <dd>text menus (requires curses(3) libraries)</dd>
  <dt>make xconfig</dt>
    <dd>using the X window system (requires X, not recommended for
    gateways)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Any of these wiil do the job. If you have no established preference, we
suggest trying <var>menuconfig</var>.</p>

<p>
For more information on configuring your kernel, see our
<a href="kernel.html">section</a> on that topic.</p>

<h3><a name="inst-test">Install and test a kernel before adding FreeS/WAN</a></h3>

<p>
You should compile, install and test the kernels as you have configured
them, so that you have a known stable starting point. The series of commands
involved is usually something like:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>make menuconfig</dt>
    <dd>choose kernel options, set up a kernel for your machine</dd>
  <dt>make dep</dt>
    <dd>find <strong>dep</strong>endencies between files</dd>
  <dt>make bzImage</dt>
    <dd>build a loadable kernel image, compressed with bzip(1)</dd>
  <dt>make install</dt>
    <dd>install it</dd>
  <dt>make modules</dt>
    <dd>build modules which can be added to a running kernel</dd>
  <dt>make modules_install</dt>
    <dd>install them</dd>
  <dt>lilo</dt>
    <dd>ensure that the boot loader sees your changes</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Doing this first means that if there is a problem after you add FreeS/WAN,
tracking it down is <em>much</em> simpler.</p>

<p>
If you need advice on this process, or general Linux background
information, try our <a href="web.html#linux.link">Linux web references</a>. The most
directly relevant document is the <a
href="http://metalab.unc.edu/LDP/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel
HowTo</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="building">Building and installing the software</a></h2>

<p>
There are several ways to build and install the software. All require that
you have kernel source, correctly configured for your machine, as a
starting point. If you don't have that yet, see the
<a href="#before">previous section</a></p>
<p>
Whatever method you choose, it will do all of the following:
<ul>
  <li>add FreeS/WAN code to the kernel
    <ul>
      <li>insert patches into standard kernel code to provide an
      interface</li>
      <li>add additional files which use that interface</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>re-configure and re-compile the kernel to activate that code</li>
  <li>install the new kernel</li>
  <li>build the non-kernel FreeS/WAN programs and install them
    <ul>
    <li><a href="manpage.d/ipsec.8.html">ipsec(8)</a> in <var>/usr/local/sbin</var>
    <li>others in <var>/usr/local/lib/ipsec</var></li>
    </ul>
  <li>install FreeS/WAN <a href="manpages.html">man pages</a> under
   <var>/usr/local/man</var></li>
  <li>create the configuration file <a
    href="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html">ipsec.conf(5)</a>. Editing this file to
    configure your IPSEC gateway is described in the <a href="config.html">next section</a>.</li>
  <li>create an RSA public/private key pair for your system and place it in <a
    href="manpage.d/ipsec.secrets.5.html">ipsec.secrets(5)</a></li>
  <li>install the initialisation script <var>/etc/rc.d/init.d/ipsec</var>
  <li>create links to that script from the <var>/etc/rc.d/rc[0-6].d</var> directories so that each run
    level starts or stops IPSEC. (If the previous sentence makes no sense to
    you, try the <a
    href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html">From
    Power-up to Bash Prompt HowTo</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can do the whole install with two commands (recommended in most cases)
or get into as much of the detail as you like.</p>

<h3><a name="allbut">Everything but kernel installation</a></h3>

<p>
To do everything except install the new kernel, <var>cd</var> into the
freeswan directory and become root. Give <strong>any one</strong> of the
following commands:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>make oldgo</dt>
    <dd>Uses FreeS/WAN's default settings for some kernel configuration
      options. Leaves all other options unchanged from your last kernel
      configuration.</dd>
  <dt>make ogo</dt>
    <dd>Invokes <var>config</var> so you can configure the kernel from the
      command line.</dd>
  <dt>make menugo</dt>
    <dd>Invokes <var>menuconfig</var> so you can configure the kernel with
      text-mode menus.</dd>
  <dt>make xgo</dt>
    <dd>Invokes <var>xconfig</var> so you can configure the kernel in an X
      window.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
You must <strong>save the new configuration even if you make no
changes</strong>. This ensures that the FreeS/WAN changes are actually seen by
the system.</p>
<p>
Our scripts save the output of <var>make</var> commands they call in files
with names like <var>out.kbuild</var> or <var>out.kinstall</var>. The last
command of each script checks the appropriate <var>out.*</var> file for error
messages.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the last output you see is <var>make</var> saying it is calling our
    <var>errcheck</var> script, then all is well. There were no errors.</li>
  <li>If not, an error has occurred. Check the appropriate <var>out.*</var>
    file for details.</li>
</ul>
<p>
For the above commands, the error files are <var>out.kpatch</var> and <var>out.kbuild</var>.
<p>
These scripts automatically build an <a href="glossary.html#RSA">RSA</a> authentication
key pair (a public key and the matching private key) for you, and put the
result in <var>/etc/ipsec.secrets</var>. For information on using RSA
authentication, see our <a href="config.html">configuration section</a>. Here, we
need only note that generating the key uses random(4) quite heavily and if
random(4) runs out of randomness, <strong>it will block until it has enough
input</strong>. You may need to provide input by moving the mouse around a
lot, or going to another window and typing random characters, or using some
command such as <var>du -s /usr</var> to generate disk activity.</p>

<h3><a name="newk">Installing the new kernel</a></h3>

<p>To install the kernel the easy way, just give this command in the FreeS/WAN
directory:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>make kinstall</dt>
    <dd>Installs the new kernel and, if required, the modules to go with
    it. Errors, if any, are reported in <var>out.kinstall</var></dd>
</dl>

<p>
Using <var>make kinstall</var> from the FreeS/WAN directory is equivalent
to giving the following sequence of commands in <var>/usr/src/linux</var>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>make</li>
  <li>make install</li>
  <li>make modules</li>
  <li>make modules_install</li>
</ul>

<p>If you prefer that sequence, use it instead.</p>

<p>
If you have some unusual setup such that the above sequence of commands
won't work on your system, then our <var>make kinstall</var> will not work
either. Use whatever method does work on your system. See our <a
href="impl.notes">implementation notes</a> file for additional information
that may help in such situations.</p>
<p>

<h3>Make sure Lilo knows about the new kernel</h3>
<p>
Check your lilo.conf(5) file to ensure it points to the right kernel,
then run lilo(8) to read lilo.conf(5) and set up the bootloader.</p>

<h2><a name="testinstall">Testing to see if install succeeded</a></h2>

<p>
To check that you have a sucessful install, you can reboot and check (by
watching messages during boot or by looking at them later with dmesg(8))
that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the kernel reports the right version. If not, you are likely still
    running your old kernel. Check your lilo.conf(5) file and the installation
    directory (defined in the kernel make file, often /boot but the default is
    /), then rerun lilo(8).</li>
  <li>KLIPS initialisation messages appear</li>
  <li>Pluto reports that it is starting</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also try the commands:</p>
<ul>
  <li><var>ipsec --version</var>, to test whether /usr/local/bin is in your
    path so you can use IPSEC administration commands</li>
  <li><var>ipsec whack --status</var>, using <a
    href="manpage.d#ipsec_whack.8.html">ipsec_whack(8)</a> to ask Pluto for
    status information</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of course any status information at this point should be uninteresting
since you have not yet configured connections.</p>

<h2>Where to go from here</h2>

<p>See the following section for information on <a href="config.html">configuring
connections</a>.</p>

<p>Alternately, you might want to look at background material on the <a
href="ipsec.html">protocols used</a> before trying configuration.</p>
