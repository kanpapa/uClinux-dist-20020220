<h1 name="interop">Interoperation with other IPSEC implementations</h1>

<p>
The IPSEC protocols are designed to allow interoperation between different
implementations. Other sections of this documentation have more detail on:
<ul> 
<li>the IPSEC <a href="ipsec.html">protocol specifications</a>
<li>parts of the protocols <a href="compat.html#spec">implemented or ommitted</a> in FreeS/WAN
<li><a href="web.html#implement">other implementations</a>
</ul>

<p>
FreeS/WAN does interoperate successfully with many other implementations.
The ones we know about are listed <a href="#mail.interop">below</a>.</p>
<p>
Of course &quot;the devil is in the details&quot; and the IPSEC protocols
have a lot of details. At least one
<a href="http://www.counterpane.com/ipsec.pdf">critique</a> has argued
that the protocols should be simplified. Various of those details can
and do cause difficulties for interoperation. Should you encounter
such problems, please let us know via the <a href="mail.html">mailing
list</a>. We will likely be able to help you, and your report may be
useful both to other users and to the implementation teams.</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> This file is updated often, whenever I notice an
interesting interop report on the mailing list. If you are reading the
version that ships with a FreeS/WAN release or is posted on the web, and
what you need isn't here, consider downloading the latest snapshot to get
the latest version of the doc. Perhaps I've added what you need since the
last release.
<p>
There is additional information on interoperability testing in our
<a href="web.html#interop">web links</a> section.

<h2><a name="patch.interop">Patches to extend interoperability</a></h2>

Sometimes interoperation requires user-contributed patches or add-ons on
the FreeS/WAN end. In general, no patches to the actual IPSEC code are required.
The problem is to make FreeS/WAN recognise RSA keys stored in formats other than
ours. Each such format needs either a patch to make FreeS/WAN understand that
format or a utility to translate it to the FreeS/WAN format.
<p>
For example, unmodified FreeS/WAN cannot use RSA keys generated by
<a href="glossary.html#PGP">PGP</a> or keys stored in
<a href="glossary.html#X.509">X.509</a> certificates, but patches or utilities
are available for both those formats. See this list of 
<a href="web.html#patch">patches and add-ons</a>.

<h2><a name="interop.problem">Interoperability problems</a></h2>

<p>
The IPSEC RFCs are complex and include a number of optional features.
  There is considerable opportunity for even two correct, standard-conforming,
  implementations to disagree on details in a way that blocks interoperation.
  Of course, misinterpretations of the standards and implementation or
  configuration errors on either end can also foul things up.</p>

  <p>That said, FreeS/WAN interoperates successfully with many other
  implementations. There is a <a href="#mail.interop">list</a> below.</p>

<p>
Known areas where problems may appear are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>FreeS/WAN does not implement single DES</strong> because <a
      href="politics.html#desnotsecure">DES is insecure</a>. Suggestions on what to do if
      the device you want to talk to has only DES are <a href="#noDES">below</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>FreeS/WAN does not implement Diffie-Hellman group 1</strong> because it
      it is not entirely clear that this is secure.</li>
    <li>The RFCs define two modes for IKE negotiations -- main mode and
      aggressive mode. Aggressive mode is slightly faster, but reveals more
      information to an eavesdropper. Specifically, it lets an eavesdropper
      know what identities are in use. <strong>FreeS/WAN does not implement
      aggressive mode</strong>, so any negotiation another implementation
      tries that way will fail.
      <p>
      In principle this should not be a problem
      since main mode support is required in all implementations and aggressive
      mode is optional.       In practice, it is sometimes a problem.
      Some implementations default to
      aggressive mode unless you configure them for main mode.</p>

    <li>
      For automatic keying, <strong>the FreeS/WAN default is to provide
      <a href="glossary.html#PFS">perfect forward secrecy</a></strong>. We see no reason not
      to; this is more secure and costs little. Some other implementations,
      however, turn PFS off by default.
      <p>
      You can turn PFS off in FreeS/WAN with the <var>pfs=no</var> setting in
      <a href="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html">ipsec.conf(5)</a>, but if possible
      we suggest you enable it on the other end instead. That is more secure.</li>
    <li>
      The IKE protocol allows several types of optional message. Two things happen
      which are allowed by the RFCs:
      <ul>
      <li>Some implementations send various optional messages.
      <li>FreeS/WAN ignores them.
      </ul>
      However, problems may arise if the other end relies on some expected effect
      of these messages. There are two FAQ questions dealing with this, one on the
      <a href="faq.html#ignore">log message</a> FreeS/WAN gives when ignoring
      optional payloads and one on the <a href="faq.html#deadtunnel">delete SA</a>
      payload.
  </ul>

<p>
The general rule is that to interoperate with FreeS/WAN, the other
implementation should be configured for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>main mode</li>
    <li>triple DES encryption</li>
    <li>Diffie-Hellman Group 2 or 5
  </ul>

<p>
This is possible for most implementations.</p>


<h3><a name="noDES">Systems that want to use single DES</a></h3>

<p>
Linux FreeS/WAN does not support single DES transforms. Neither Pluto's IKE
connections nor KLIPS' IPSEC connections can use DES. Since
<a href="politics.html#desnotsecure">DES is insecure</a> we do not,
and will not at any future time, provide it.</p>

<p>
DES is, unfortunately, a mandatory part of the <a href="glossary.html#IPSEC">IPSEC</a>
standard. Despite that, we will not implement DES. We believe it is more
important to provide security than to comply with a standard which has been
<a href="politics.html#weak">subverted</a> into allowing weak algorithms. See our
<a href="politics.html">history
and politics</a> section for discussion.</p>

<p>
Some implementations may offer DES as the default. In such cases we urge
you to change them to <a href="glossary.html#3DES">Triple DES</a>. If this is not
possible, for example because <a href="politics.html#exlaw">export laws</a> prevent your
vendor from offerring you adequate crytography, we urge you to complain
vigorously to one or more of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your government, especially any department concerned with protecting citizens' 
      privacy or your nation's communication infrastructure</li>
    <li>the vendor</li>
    <li>the embassy of the nation whose laws are problematic for you</li>
  </ul>

<p>
Consider using FreeS/WAN instead. PCs are cheap and we deliver 3DES now.

<p>
FreeS/WAN does have <a href="glossary.html#DES">DES</a> code in it as a sort of
historical accident, since we need it to implement our default (currently,
our only) block cipher, <a href="glossary.html#3DES">Triple DES</a>. However, since <a
href="politics.html#desnotsecure">DES is insecure</a>, we do not provide any interface to
that code.</p>
<p>
As a matter of project policy, we will not help anyone subvert FreeS/WAN
to provide <a href="politics.html#desnotsecure">insecure DES encryption</a>.

<h3><a name="oldswan">Older versions of FreeS/WAN</a></h3>

Any two versions of FreeS/WAN should interoperate, and many combinations
have been tested doing so successfully. In particular, every release is
tested against its predecessor before it goes out.
<p>
However, if you do encounter a problem involving an older version, we are
likely to suggest you upgrade. We do not have the resources to support
multiple versions.
<p>
The <a href="faq.html#old_to_new">FAQ</a> also discusses this.

He has also talked of porting NetBSD's isakmpd(8) to Linux, but has (as
of late April '99) made no announcement of availability. This would provide

&gt; For FreeBSD, I find list discussion of 3DES key formats, presumably for manual
&gt; keying. We have 192-bit, 3 64-bit keys including parity bits, while FreeBSD 4.0
&gt; used 168-bit, 3 56-bit keys without the parity bits. Has FreeBSD changed this?

I still don't understand what made Spike Gronim say that KAME wants a
168 bits key; I have always been using 192 bits keys with KAME and had
no interoperability problem between KAME and FreeS/WAN using manual
keying.

&gt; For auto keying, I find reports of sucessful use of pre-shared secrets, but
&gt; nothing on RSA authentication.

I had KAME (20001023 snapshot) and FreeS/WAN 1.6 successfully
interoperate using both PSK and RSA-sig authentication. The config
files, certificates and test keys used are available online:
http://www.hsc.fr/ipsec/ipsec2000/kame/
http://www.hsc.fr/ipsec/ipsec2000/freeswan/
Not much details though, as this is just a report and not a how-to. Will
improve it if I can find spare time.

&gt; Does FreeBSD support that? 

KAME can use RSA-sig and can either exchange certificates online or get
them from a file. I tested the latter. No test with the X.509 patch for
FreeS/WAN yet, though that's in my short term plans too.

&gt; Are the key formats compatible, or has anyone written translation code?

KAME wants the keys inside certificates, in PEM format. To extract the
keys for FreeS/WAN I used the fswcert utility, but it can be done "by
hand" using openssl.

Subject: cisco &lt;-&gt; pluto IKE interop is here........
   Date: Thu, 28 Jan 1999
   From: Ian Calderbank

Ok, tried todays pluto (28 jan) snapshot against a (wait for it) 3des
cisco box, one with some more serious grunt for benchmarking when the time
comes. 

And the good news is that pluto and cisco's IKE seem to interoperate. At
the end of things both devices seem to be happy that they have IKE and
IPSEC SA's. I can't send any traffic over it cos klips seems to be broken
(peter seems to be on the case), but fundamentally, pluto seems to be
interoperable with cisco for SA negotiation.

I've attached some ipsec barf output - pluto still complains a few times,
but it gets there :-)

A later message from Ian:</p>

This configuration is provided as-is and with no assistance or guarantee
that it works whatsover. In particular your attention is drawn to the versions
of operating systems and IPSEC that were used in the test. Configurations
for later versions of freeswan and cisco IOS may well be different.

Cisco router: 3640 (R4700 processor), ios 12.0(2a)T1), 3DES IPSEC feature set
( you do need the 3des version).
Linux box: P150, freeswan 29/jan/99 snapshot, Redhat 5.2, kernel 2.0.36.
Interconnect: 10 Base T.
Algorithm: ESP 3des/md5

CPU loadings: 
Cisco 3640 : 98%
Freeswan P150 : load average: 0.08, 0.06, 0.01

Throughput: 1.1 Mbit/sec at the application layer, approx 1.2Mbit/sec, 100 packet/sec on 
the external network. There were no chokes present, so the limit would 
appear to be the 3640, given it was running near flat out.

A message from another user about using RSA keys with Cisco:
<pre>
From: jrussi@uol.com.br
Subject: Re:Re: Re:Re: [Users] RSA public key and Cisco (3640)
Date: Sat, 2 Jun 2001

We use Cisco IOS 12.1.5(T) and freeswan 1.8

Here an example on how I copied the key from cisco:

Key Data:
  117C311E 16192D86 8886C71D 11111115 11138B11 31881241 11C7E23B D6DB22 
  18DEC1BD....

Will become

0x117C311E16192D868886C71D1111111511138B113188124111C7E23BD6DB2218DEC1BD...  

We used at least 1024 bits long keys.

But it doesn´t matter. The problem is that cisco doesn´t agree with the RSA schema from freeswan, I think. In Cisco, rsasig is to use with a CA, and rsaencript did not work as well. 

My case is worse than it. My first intention was to use freeswan in a road warrior config. I really need to use CA, as Cisco needs a fix address to use rsa public key. The public key to cisco is always associated to an IP address ou FQDN. I quit. Will try the X509 patch and the Open CA software.

<h3><a name="bay">Nortel (Bay Networks) Contivity switch</a></h3>

There is one known issue in FreeS/WAN-to-Contivity interoperation.
Recent versions of FreeS/WAN no longer support DH group 1 for key
exchange. Older versions of Contivity software support nothing else.
Group 2 was added in more recent releases. So:
<ul>
<li>older FreeS/WANs, such as 1.5, will work with any Contivity software.
Key exchange will be done using DH Group 1. This may not be secure.
<li>current FreeS/WANs will work only with recent Contivity releases
supporting DH Group 2. Contivity 3.5 is one such release.
</ul>
We recommend using the latest Contivity release.

More interoperability results:

I successfully established a tunnel with a Nortel (formerly Bay (formerly New Oak)) Contivity
Extranet Switch running the latest release versions.

The CES is running V2.50 of the software and the Linux server is running V1.0.0 of the Free/SWAN
code on a RedHat 5.2 unit with the kernel upgraded to 2.0.36-3

I am using IKE with 3DES-HMAC-MD5

Note however, that tunnels cannot yet be configured as client tunnels since Free/SWAN does not yet
support aggressive mode.  Hopefully, that will arrive soon, which would allow remote users to
connect to a CES using the Free/SWAN code as clients.

Nortel's Contivity IPSEC server has a formal policy of interoperability
with FreeS/WAN.   I was quite pleased to hear it when they last talked to us,
and it makes sense in their business environment, since they let you use
their WinXX client software free, so this gives them support for Linux
clients.

Subject: Nortel Contivity and Free-S/WAN
   Date: Wed, 7 Mar 2001
   From:  "JJ Streicher-Bremer" &lt;jj@digisle.net&gt;

OK, here is a very brief nuts and bolts breakdown on how to get this
combo working.  I want to thank everyone at Free-S/WAN and everyone on
the list for your help in getting this to work.

Connecting FreeS/WAN to the Nortel Networks Contivity Extranet Switch:

What you need:
FreeS/WAN v1.5 and Contivity ver 2.5 - 3.5 (might work with earlier
versions, but I have not tested it with this config)
or
FreeS/WAN v1.8 and COntivity ver 3.5 (the 3.5 version supports Diffe
Hilman group 2 key exchange)

What to do:
1 - Configure the Contivity:
   Set up a branch office tunnel group with the following settings:
        
        Connectivity:
        Nailed Up: Disabled
        Access Hours: Anytime
        Call Admission Priority: Highest Priority
        Forwarding Priority: Low Priority
        Idle Timeout: 00:00:00
        Forced Logoff: 00:00:00
        RSVP: Disabled
        RSVP: Token Bucket Depth: 3000 Bytes
        RSVP: Token Bucket Rate: 28 Kbps
        Branch Office Bandwidth Policy: 
        - Committed Rate: 56 Kbps
        - Excess Rate: 128 Kbps
        - Excess Action: Mark

        Encryption: 
        - ESP - Triple DES with SHA1 Integrity: Enabled
        - ESP - Triple DES with MD5 Integrity: Enabled
        - ESP - 56-bit DES with SHA1 Integrity: Disabled
        - ESP - 56-bit DES with MD5 Integrity: Disabled
        *IKE Encryption and Diffie-Hellman Group: Triple DES with Group
2 (1024-bit prime)
        Vendor ID: Disabled
        Perfect Forward Secrecy: Enabled
        Compression: Disabled
        Rekey Timeout: 08:00:00
        Rekey Data Count:  (None) 
        *ISAKMP Retransmission Interval: 16
        *ISAKMP Retransmission Max Attempts: 4

        Set up a branch office tunnel inside this new group with the
following settings:
        
        Endpoint Addresses
        Local - Public address of your COntivity
        Remote - Your Free-S/WAN interface Address
                Tunnel Type - IPSEC
        IPSEC Authentication - Text Pre-Shared Key
                One note here, I have had some trouble trying to use HEX
or Non alphanumeric chars in this key.
        
        Under IP:
        Static Routing
        Local - networks you want to be able to access through the
tunnel
        Remote - networks that will be allowed through the tunnel
        NAT - None

   Get routing setup on your office network:
        You will need to get a routing entry that will point all traffic
bound for your home network (the one that will be acciessible through
the tunnel) to the internal interface of the contivity system.

   Configure Free-S/WAN:
        Install, compile, and test Free-S/WAN
        Edit ipsec.conf for your new tunnel:
--------------------------------------------------------        
ipsec.conf --

        right=172.16.0.2
        rightsubnet=172.16.2.0/24

ipsec.secrets --
10.0.0.2 172.16.0.2 "Your big secret"
---------------------------------------------

The above config is for this imaginary network:

         +------+
10.0.1.1 |      |10.0.0.2   10.0.0.1++ Internet

=========++--------------####---------172.16.2.0/24 are here somewhere
   Office Router       Contivity
   
   
   This has worked for me.  I am still having trouble with the tunnels
dying after about 30-40 minutes of non-use.  Don't know what that is
about, but I'll keep you posted.

<h4><a name="raptorman">Raptor manual keying</a></h4>

A mailing list suggestion from FreeS/WAN technical lead Henry Spencer:
<pre>
&gt; In the Raptor settings, there are 2 sets of data (1 for each end). Each set
&gt; contains an SPI, 3 DES Keys and 1 MD5 hash. I only know how to include one
&gt; set, how do I include the other set? Is the other set needed?

They may be using different keys for each direction, which is a bit
unusual for manual keying, but not impossible.  The simplest thing is
probably to just give it two identical sets of data -- that should work.
FreeS/WAN has provisions for asymmetric keys etc. in manual keying, but
that stuff is lightly documented and lightly tested.

Sending the following to the list, at Hugh's request.

Hugh,

&gt; Good.  But we don't think that you should be using our IPCOMP just
&gt; yet.  It is flaky :-(

I've seen no anomalies, although "allow ipcomp" is on at the Gauntlet 
end.  Looking at my ipsec.conf I actually find no refereence to ipcomp. 
 I presume it is disabled by default.  In addition, reviewing my logs 
both on the Gauntlet end and the Linux end, I see nothing I can 
interpret as an indication that ipcomp was enabled during negotiation.  
So I have to correct my previous posting - I believe the link is *not* 
using ipcomp.

&gt; This is interesting and we'd love a more complete writeup.  It should
&gt; get incorporated into our interop documentation.

Here are the relevant bits from ipsec.conf:

config setup
        interfaces=%defaultroute
        klipsdebug=none
        plutodebug=none
        plutoload=%search
        plutostart=%search
        uniqueids=yes

conn freeswan17-gauntlet55
        auto=start
        type=tunnel
        left=1.1.1.1
        leftnexthop=1.1.1.2
        leftsubnet=10.0.1.0/24
        right=3.3.3.3
        rightnexthop=3.3.3.4
        rightsubnet=10.0.2.0/24
        authby=secret
        keyexchange=ike
        ikelifetime=480m
        auth=esp
        esp=3des-md5-96
        keylife=480m
        keyingtries=8
        pfs=no
        rekeymargin=9m
        rekeyfuzz=25%

All settings on the Gauntlet side are the same (not shown here, as GUI 
screenshots are hard to show in ASCII... and the textual format that is 
generated by the Gauntlet GUI is ugly in the extreme).

Note that ikelifetime is 1440m by default on the Gauntlet end, but 
freeswan does not support this value (max appears to be 480m), thus the 
Gauntlet end is also set to 480m to match freeswan's value.

Also worth noting: I am using the excellent Seawall scripts to manage 
ipchains configuration on the freeswan end.  It automatically generates 
a correct set of firewall rules for the link (along with doing many 
other convenient things).

Subject: Re: Pb establishing connection from FW1/3DES/SP2 with freeswan 1.5 - ACTE 2
   Date: Tue, 6 Feb 2001
   From: Claudia Schmeing &lt;claudia@freeswan.org&gt;
 
&gt; Thanx to Michael and Claudia, but this doesn't work from VPN1 to linux (as
&gt; linux to VPN1 is OK).
...

&gt; I think that VPN1 doesn't send "192.168.1.0/24" but "192.168.1.20/32" and,
&gt; as Claudia said, IPSEC SA need to match Exactly. 

I don't know about the rules on the VPN-1. You'll have to rely on people 
with applicable experience there...

&gt; Is it possible that freeswan doesn't do the inclusion process (ie if he
&gt; receive 192.168.1.20/32, i doesn't match that this is include in
&gt; 192.168.1.0/24) ?

Yes, that's correct. It needs to match exactly, and inclusion is not
part of this process.
 
&gt; Btw why VPN/1 send 192.168.1.20/32 and not 192.168.1.20/24 (the value that
&gt; Freeswan is waiting for)? A bug?

I think Michael may be able to help you with this.

&gt; Have i a way to force Freeswan to do the "inclusion" (ie accept 
&gt; 192.168.1.20/32 as a part of 192.160.1.20/24, even if the 2 IPSEC Sa 
&gt; doesn't match exactly) ?

No, but...
Another strategy is to accept the fact that the Checkpoint 
proposes separate connections for each machine. If you define 
and add each of these connections on the Linux FreeS/WAN side, then 
Linux FreeS/WAN ought to accept the Checkpoint's proposals.

The only possible difficulty with this strategy is that I don't know 
how Linux FreeS/WAN handles the concept of overlapping tunnels. I
believe, though, that these tunnels can coexist, and if for any 
packet there are two options, a more general and a less general, the
packet will be handled by the more specific tunnel. You would need
to do a little testing to ensure you understand the behaviour and
that this does actually solve your problem.

I think it would be simplest to try to get the Checkpoint to propose the 
more general tunnel. Since I don't recall having seen this problem before, 
I suspect the simpler solution is doable.

Hello, FreeS/WAN community !

SSH Communications Security Corp has released a new public beta #3
version of SSH Sentinel VPN client for Windows. We've got a lot of
reports also from FreeS/WAN community and with that feedback we've
improved interoperability and stability. 

For example PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy in IKE rekey) can now be used
between SSH Sentinel and FreeSWAN, and if using that user contributed
X.509 patch and exporting the certificate from SSH Sentinel, now those
-----[BEGIN|END] CERTIFICATE----- headers/footers are properly included
in the exported PEM formatted certificate, so it can be imported to
FreeSWAN with fswcert utility and OpenSSL tools. 

Thank you a lot for your feedback, colleagues !

You can get that new public beta #3 and PDF formatted User Manual from
ftp://ftp.ssh.com/pub/sentinel/ or via website
http://www.ipsec.com/products/sentinel/beta/register.html

For more information about the product, please check our website

<p>
Watchguard do not use FreeS/WAN in their product. They have their own IPSEC implementation.
<p>
We have had mailing list reports of successful interoperation
between FreeS/WAN and the Watchguard firewall, using manually
keyed connections. The user could not get automatically
keyed connections to work; the message below explains this.
<p>
Here is some mail from a Watchguard employee about interoperation:

<pre>
Subject: FreeS/WAN and WatchGuard Firebox interop
   Date: Mon, 18 Dec 2000
   From: Max Enders &lt;menders@watchguard.com&gt;

I was recently given the task of testing IPSec interoperability
with our product, the Firebox. I just wanted to let you know that
I had success with a manual keyed tunnel. Here's what I used for
my test:

RedHat Linux 6.2
Linux 2.2.18 i686 unknown
Linux FreeS/WAN 1.8
"Trusted" interface: 192.168.0.1/24
"External" interface: 192.168.1.1/24

Firebox II FastVPN
WatchGuard Live Security System v4.5
Trusted interface: 192.168.2.1/24
External interface: 192.168.1.2/24

Because FreeS/WAN does not implement single DES, a dynamic keyed
tunnel will not work. Our product strictly uses DES for main mode.
We hope to address this in a future release. Here are instructions
for configuring the Firebox:

Open the Policy Manager and create a new IPSec gateway. Set the Key
Negotiation Type to manual and enter the FreeS/WAN box's external
IP address for the Remote Gateway IP. Configure a new tunnel with
a unique SPI. Select 3DES-CBC for Encryption and MD5-HMAC for
Authentication. Make an Encryption Key and Authentication Key.
Copy the values and save them for configuration of the FreeS/WAN box.
Configure a routing policy and any necessary services as you normally
would.

Here's how I configured FreeS/WAN:

Modifications to /etc/ipsec.conf:

Under the "config setup" section, add:

manualstart=firebox

At the end of the file, add the following connection:

conn firebox
left=192.168.1.1
leftsubnet=192.168.0.0/24
right=192.168.1.2
rightsubnet=192.168.2.0/24
spi=0x101
esp=3des-md5-96
espenckey=0x515b0875793e3708517c3d4554012f7c0273375e51572a31
espauthkey=0x072649041c2c0d452f7c15407576522f

The spi used here should match the Firebox's. Note that the Policy Manager
expects an SPI in decimal, not hexadecimal. The espenckey value should be
0x and the Encryption Key you're using on the Firebox. Likewise for
espauthkey and the Authentication Key on the Firebox.

between FreeS/WAN and Watchguard Firebox II and therefore showed me that my
efforts would not be wasted!...

Yes indeed FreeS/WAN to WatchGuard Firebox only works in manual keying mode
and the best way to generate keys is to have the firebox generate the keys,
then copy and paste into the ipsec.conf file on the FreeS/WAN side (don't
forget to prefix the keys with '0x' in your ipsec.conf file.

Also keep in mind that the SPI is in decimal on the Firebox side and HEX on
the FreeS/WAN side!!!  We spent 4 hours on fixing this HEX-DEC issue only :)

Here's another datapoint for the "FreeS/WAN interoperability
database".

I tested 0.92 against the Xedia Access Point/QVPN product, using
dynamic keying (i.e., Pluto at work).

Results: it works fine so long as you ask for 3DES.  DES and no-crypto 
modes don't work when Pluto is involved.

I did limited data testing, which seemed to be fine.  No performance
numbers yet, could do that if people are interested.

Any questions, please ask.

Network Associates announced PGP 6.5 today.  It includes a new product
PGPnet which is a full IKE/IPSec client implementation.  This product

One version is downloadable at no cost for non-commercial use. See
our <a href="web.html#tools">links</a>. That version does not support
subnets. 
<p>
Several of the user-written HowTos mentioned <a href="#otherpub">above</a>

<p>
A more recent post from the same PGP Inc staff member pointed out:
<pre>
Make sure you're using PGP 7.0 or later as the key parser was improved
in that release.  (PGP 7.0.1 was just released)

<p>
Various users have reported various successes and problems talking to
PGPnet with FreeS/WAN. There has also been a fairly complex discussion of
some fine points of RFC interpretation between the implementers of the two
systems. Check an archive of our <a href="mail.html">mailing list</a> for

| From: Yan Seiner
|
| OK, I'm stumped.  I am trying to configure IPSEC to support road
| warriors using PGPnet 6.5.
| 
| I've set up everything as per the man pages on the ipsec side.
| 
| I've set up everything on the PGPnet side per the docs for that package.
| 
| Pluto fails with this:
| 
| Jan 16 08:14:11 aphrodite Pluto[26401]: "homeusers" #8: no acceptable
| Oakley Transform
| 
| and then it terminates the connection.

As far as I can tell/remember, there are three common ways that PGPnet
and FreeS/WAN don't get along.

1. PGPnet proposes a longer lifetime for an SA than Pluto is willing
   to accept.

2. After rekeying (i.e. after building a new SA bundle because the old
   one is about to expire), FreeS/WAN immediately switches to the new
   one while PGPnet continues using the old

3. FreeS/WAN defaults to expecting Perfect Forward Secrecy and PGPnet
   does not.

Perhaps you are bumping into the first.  In any case, look back
in the log to see why Pluto rejected each transform

   Subject: Re: Secure Gate Fails- PGPNet &amp; FreeSwan
   Date: Wed, 28 Jun 2000
   From: Andreas Haumer &lt;andreas@xss.co.at&gt;

I have a PGPnet setup running with FreeS/WAN working as secure 
gateway. It works quite fine, except for a re-negotiation problem 
I'm currently investigating, and in fact I have it running on some
test equipment here right now!

As I tried _several_ different non-working configuration settings 
I think I know the exact _one_ which works... :-)

Here's my short "HOWTO":

FreeS/WAN version: snap1000jun25b
PGPnet: PGP Personal Privacy, Version 6.5.3
Linux: 2.2.16 with some patches

Network setup:
=============

internal subnet [192.168.x.0/24]
|
|        [192.168.x.1]
secure gateway with FreeS/WAN
|        [a.b.c.x]
|
|        [a.b.c.y]
router to internet
|
|   Internet
|
|        [dynamically assigned IP address]
road-warrior with PGPnet


Configuration of FreeS/WAN:
==========================

a) /etc/ipsec.conf

config setup
        interfaces=%defaultroute
        klipsdebug=none
        plutodebug=none
        plutoload=%search
        plutostart=%search

conn %default
        keyingtries=1
        authby=secret
        left=a.b.c.x
        leftnexthop=a.b.c.y

conn gw-rw
        right=0.0.0.0
        auto=add

conn subnet-rw
        leftsubnet=192.168.x.0/24
        right=0.0.0.0
        auto=add                          


b) /etc/ipsec.secrets

a.b.c.x 0.0.0.0: "my very secret secret"   


Note: If you are running ipchains on your secure gateway,
you have to open the firewall for all the IPsec packets 
and also for traffic from your ipsec interface!
Don't masquerade the IPsec traffic!

Check your logfiles if the firewall is blocking some 
important packets!


Configuration of PGPnet:
=======================

(note that there is an excellent description, including
screenshots of PGPnet, on &lt;http://jixen.tripod.com/&gt;)

In short, do the following:

Launch the PGPnet configuration tool and set defaults options
=============================================================

Start - Program - PGP - PGPnet
View - Options
General Panel :
  Expert Mode
  Allow communications with unconfigured hosts
  Require valid authentication key
  Cache passphrases between logins
  IKE Duration : 6h
  IPsec : 6h
Advanced panel :
  Selected options :
    Ciphers : Tripple DES
    Hashes : MD5
    Diffie-Hellman : 1024 and 1536
    Compression : LZS and Deflate
  Make the IKE proposal :
    Shared-Key - MD5 - 3DES -1024 bits on top of the list (move up)
  Make the IPSec proposal :
    NONE - MD5-TrippleDES -NONE on top of the list (move up)
  Select Perfect Forward Secrecy = 1024 bits
Press OK


Create the connection's definition.
==================================

In the Hosts panel, ADD
  Name : Enter a name for the right gateway
  IPaddress : Enter its IP address visible to the internet (a.b.c.x)
  Select Secure Gateway
  Set shared Paraphrase : enter you preshared key
  Identity type : select IP address
  Identity : enter 0.0.0.0
  Remote Authentication : select Any valid key
Press Ok
  Select the newly created entry for the right gateway and click ADD,
YES
  Name : Enter a name for the central subnet
  IP address : Enter its network IP address (192.168.x.0)
  Select Insecure Subnet
  Subnet Mask : enter its subnetmask (255.255.255.0)
Press OK, YES, YES                             


This should be it. Note that with this configuration there is
still this re-keying problem: after 6 hours, the SA is expired
and the connection fails. You have to re-connect your connection
with PGPnet.</pre>

  <p>and a note from the team's tech support person:</p>
  <pre>Date: Thu, 29 Jun 2000
From: Claudia Schmeing 

There is a known issue with PGPNet which I don't see mentioned in the docs.
It's likely related to this one, that you note on the site:

&gt;2. After rekeying (i.e. after building a new SA bundle because the old
&gt;   one is about to expire), FreeS/WAN immediately switches to the new
&gt;   one while PGPnet continues using the old

The issue is: When taking down and subsequently recreating a connection, 
it can appear to come up, but it is unusable because PGPNet continues
to use an old SA, which Linux FreeS/WAN no longer recognizes. The solution is
to take down the old connection using PGPNet, so that it will then
use the most recently generated SA.</pre>

Subject: RE: linux-ipsec: PGPnet and Freeswan one more time...
   Date: Sat, 16 Dec 2000
  From: &quot;Tim Wilson&quot; &lt;timwilson@mediaone.net&gt;

Here are some details about using the IRE SafeNet Soft/PK client with a
FreeSwan gateway.

I applied the x509 patch to Pluto according to the instructions. I use the
&quot;leftcert&quot; and &quot;rightcert&quot; keywords in the ipsec.conf file. This causes
FreeSwan to read the public keys and identities from the cert files. The
identities wanted and used by FreeSwan will then be the DNs in the certs.

I used OpenSSL to generate keys and certs and to sign certs. When generating
the gateway cert, you should *not* enter an e-mail address because it turns
out that confuses Soft/PK. Also, Andreas Steffan tells me that you want to
keep the cert short to avoid fragmentation, so use a 1024-bit RSA key and
succinct names.

The FreeSwan gateway cert goes in /etc/ipsec.d/, the gateway private key is
extracted from the key file using fswcert (part of the x509 patch) and
pasted into /etc/ipsec.secrets, and a DER version of the gateway cert goes
in /etc/x509cert.der. This is all according to the instructions that
accompany the x509 patch.

The Windows client is of course running Soft/PK in this case. I generated a
private key and cert for the client on the Linux machine using OpenSSL. I
created a pkcs12 file containing the client's private key and cert, which I
put on a floppy and imported into Soft/PK. I also imported the gateway cert
into Soft/PK (you can either import a self-signed cert for the gateway or
the self-signed cert for the CA that signed the gateway cert--either works).

Soft/PK allows you to configure practically everything for the connection.
Here are the main points to watch for:

On the first panel you have to set the peer identities. The gateway will
identify itself using the DN in the gateway cert. So of course you have to
configure Soft/PK to look for the correct DN. There's no problem with this
as long as you didn't enter an e-mail address in the gateway cert. Just
check &quot;Connect using Secure Gateway tunnel&quot;, set ID type to &quot;Distinguished
Name&quot;, and enter the correct info in the dialog box.

In &quot;My identity&quot; just select the client cert that you imported in pcks12
format. Soft/PK apparently identifies itself with the DN from the cert,
which is exactly what FreeSwan is looking for.

In &quot;Security Policy&quot;, you want Main mode and make the PFS setting agree with
whatever FreeSwan is doing (FreeSwan uses PFS by default). If you use PFS I
believe you must use DH group 2 as FreeSwan doesn't like group 1.

Phase 1 Authentication must be &quot;RSA signatures&quot; and 3DES plus either MD5 or
SHA-1 (I used MD5 but I believe FreeSwan accepts either). I left the
lifetime unspecified. Also you must select DH group 2 because I believe that
FreeSwan will not accept group 1.

Phase 2 also must use 3DES and MD5 or SHA-1. I used no compression and only
ESP and no AH, haven't tried other choices.

Hope this helps.

   From: Derick Cassidy &lt;dcthebrain@geek.com&gt;

Just a quick note of success.  TimeStep Permit/Gate (2520) and
Free/Swan (June 4th snapshot) interoperate!

I have them working in AUTO mode, with IKE.  IPSec SA's are negotiated
with 3DES and MD5.

Here are the configs and a diagram for both configs.

left subnet---| Timestep | --- internet --- | Linux box |

The left subnet is defined as the red side of the timestep box.
 This network definition MUST exist in the Secure Map.

On the Linux box:

ipsec.conf

conn timestep
        type=tunnel
        left=209.yyy.xxx.6
        leftnexthop=209.yyy.xxx.1
        leftsubnet=209.yyy.xxx.128/25
        right=24.aaa.bbb.203
        rightnexthop=24.aaa.bbb.1
        rightsubnet=24.aaa.bbb.203/32
        keyexchange=ike
        keylife=8h
        keyingtries=0

In the TimeStep permit/gate Secure Map

begin static-map
        target "209.yyy.xxx.128/255.255.255.128"
        mode   "ISAKMP-Shared"
        tunnel "209.yyy.xxx.6"
end

In the TimeStep Security Descriptor file

begin security-descriptor
        Name    "High"
        IPSec   "ESP 3DES MINUTES 300 or ESP 3DES HMAC MD5 MINUTES 300"
        ISAKMP  "IDENTITY PFS 3DES MD5 MINUTES 1440
                                or DES MD5 MINUTES 1440"
end

The timestep has a shared secret for 24.aaa.bbb.203/255.255.255.255
set in the Shared Secret Authentication tab of Permit/Config.</pre>

<h3><a name="radguard">Radguard</a></h3>

Here are some mailing list comments from FreeS/WAN tech support person
Claudia Schmeing on this:
<pre>
It certainly has been possible to interop between Radguard VPN gateways and
past Linux FreeS/WAN versions, as is evidenced by 
http://www.opus1.com/vpn/atl99display.html, as well as my own interop results
from San Diego this year. There have been no major changes since SD that 
I would foresee affecting this.

The Radguard team said that their VPN gateway will not respond to a peer 
request with PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) on, but it *will* successfully 
establish such a connection with Linux FreeS/WAN when Radguard is the
initiator. Since PFS is a desirable feature in terms of cryptographic
security, this asymmetry may frustrate efforts to provide a connection that 
is both as reliable as secure as possible.

While it's not clear that rekeying will present a problem, I suspect that 
some fine tuning of the key life parameters may be needed. Unfortunately 
I was unable to do additional tests on this topic.

Due to the PFS issue, when trying to maintain a connection with PFS,
you may need to set the rekeying times shorter on the radguard side,
in order to ensure that it is always the initiator.

<pre>
&gt; I have a VPN setup between two subnets (192.168.1.x and 192.168.2.x).  I
&gt; would like to be able to join the NT domain on 192.168.1.x from the
&gt; 192.168.2.x subnet.  Is this possible?  Do I have to forward specific ports
&gt; to do this?  I've already set up WINS entries for all the machines, so
&gt; accessing computers by their NetBIOS names works perfectly.  Please let me
&gt; know about this domain thing.  Thanks!
</pre>
Dilan Arumainathan answered:
<pre>
All you need to do is to:

1. Enable NetBIOS over TCP.
2. Create a "lmhosts" file and enter the address of a BDC or a PDC like
    192.168.1.[x]  [Your PDC/BDC servername] #PRE #DOM:[Your Domain Name]
    eg. 192.168.1.1 MYOWNPDC #PRE #DOM:DENSI-NT

3. Reboot if necessary.
</pre>
and Sebastien Pfieffer provided a slightly different answer:
<pre>
For a trust relationship to work between NT domains in different
(sub)nets all domain controllers of the 1st domain have to know about
all controllers of the other domain.
Either you use the described LMHOSTS entry for every domain controller
of both domains or consider setting up WINS service(s).
</pre>
We suspect that in some cases it may be more complex than that. See the
discussion of <a href="#lin2k">Linux services and Windows 2000</a> below
and the <a href="#otherpub">Interop HowTo</a> documents listed above.

<h3><a name="win2k">Windows 2000</a></h3>

<p>
Windows 2000 ships with an IPSEC implementation built in. There may be
  restrictions. We have had mailing list reports that only the server version
  will act as a gateway, working with a subnet behind it, and other versions
  offer only "client" functionality, with no subnet. We are unclear on
  details.</p>

  <p>Some versions of Windows 2000 ship with only weak encryption. You need to
  upgrade them with the strong encryption pack, available either via the
  Windows 2000 update service or from Microsoft's web site.</p>

  <p>Windows 2000 IPSEC sometimes exhibits remarkably odd behaviour. It will
  allow you to configure it for 3DES only, then ignore your settings and fall
  back to single DES in some circumstances. Microsoft have said they will fix
  this. See this <a
  href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,36336,00.html">Wired
  article</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="lin2k">Other Linux services related to Win 2000</a></h4>

<p>
Windows 2000 also uses a number of other security mechanisms which have
Linux equivalents. To integrate well with Windows 2000, you may need to look
at several open source projects other than FreeS/WAN:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Windows 2000 builds L2TP tunnels over (some of?) its IPSEC
      connections. There is a Linux <a href="http://www.marko.net/l2tp/">L2TP
      Daemon</a>.</li>

The Windows 2000 Kerberos implementation includes proprietary modifications. This is
a security worry since it is by no means clear that the modified version remains 
secure. It also creates interoperation problems. Microsoft have released documentation
on their modifications, but only under a license that hampers attempts either to audit
their code for security flaws or to build other implementations that interoperate
with it.</li>

Here is a mailing list message, from FreeS/WAN team tech support person
Claudia Schmeing, discussing Windows 2000 and L2TP:
<pre>
You write,

&gt; I want some information about IPsec with L2TP.
&gt; I'm going to build the IPsec tunnel on the L2TP tunnel.
&gt; Is it strange?
&gt; Is there any case like this already implemented?

It's used, but rarely. In many cases, IPSec alone is sufficient. 

In this thread, Timo Teras reports that he configured the L2TP/IPSec 
hybrid with Win2k. He gives some pointers.

As for IPSEC interoperation between Windows 2000 and FreeS/WAN,
there are several web sites listed under <a href="#otherpub">Interop HowTo</a> documents

Subject: Win2000 IPsec  interop. in tunnel mode
Date: Tue, 29 Feb 2000

This was a pain.... but it worked. ;)
 
Win2000 Server against Freeswan 1.1 in tunnel mode is a success.
 
My Setup
 
Freeswan :
Kernel 2.2.12 running Freeswan 1.1
Using 3DES-MD5 and PreShared Keys.
 
Win2000
M$ Win2000 Advanced server patched for 3DES
 
 
Here's the setup for the Win2000 Server.
 
Open an MMC with the IPsec Security policy editor snap-in.
Create a new IP Security Policy.
Create 2 IP SECURITY RULES. One for inbound traffic and one for outbound trafic (see below)
Create 2 IP FILTERS. One for inbound traffic and one for outbound trafic (see below)
Assign the inbound IP SECURITY RULE to the inbound IP FILTERS, same for outbound.
Select both IP SECURITY RULES.
Select your IP Security Policy, right click and ASSIGN.
 
 
We need an example to clarify that !@#!&? logic :
 
In freeswan : 
 
Conn Interop_Testing
Left=1.2.3.4
Leftsubnet=10.0.0.0/8
Right=9.8.7.6
Rightsubnet=192.168.0.0/24
 
 
In Win2000
 
IP Security Policy : Interop_Testing
 
**********
1st IP Security rule : Left_to_Right
        IP Filter  List : Left_to_Right
                Source Address = 1.2.3.4
                Destination Address = A specific Subnet = 192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0
        Filter Action : Request Security
        Connections type : All connections
        Tunnel Settings : Endpoint = 9.8.7.6
        Authentication Method = PreSharedKey=yourkey
***********    
        
**********
2nd IP Security rule : Right_to_Left
        IP Filter  List : Right_to_Left
                Source Address = 9.8.7.6
                Destination Address = A specific Subnet = 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0
        Filter Action : Request Security
        Connections type : All connections
        Tunnel Settings : Endpoint = 1.2.3.4
        Authentication Method = PreSharedKey=yourkey
***********    
 
 
HINTS :
 
Do not use mirroring in your IP filters.
Move your main proposal to the top (in my case 3DES-MD5)
Enable PFS.
 
It worked... but a RoadWarrior configuration doesnt seems to be
possible here (must specify both Endpoints and 0.0.0.0 is not acceptable).

<p>
The RoadWarrior problem has since been solved. RSA authentication has
been added to FreeS/WAN since the above message was posted.
