<h1><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h1>

<p>This section gives an overview of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>what IP Security (IPSEC) does</li>
  <li>how IPSEC works</li>
  <li>why we are implementing it for Linux</li>
  <li>how this implementation works</li>
</ul>

<p>
This section is intended to cover only the essentials, <em>things you
should know before trying to use FreeS/WAN.</em></p>

<p>
For more detailed background information, see the <a
href="politics.html">history and politics</a> and <a href="ipsec.html">IPSEC
protocols</a> sections.</p>

<h2><a name="ipsec.intro">IPSEC, Security for the Internet Protocol</a></h2>

<p>
FreeS/WAN is a Linux implementation of the IPSEC (IP security) protocols.
IPSEC provides encryption and authentication services at the IP (Internet
Protocol) level of the network protocol stack.
<p>
Working at this level, IPSEC can protect any traffic carried over IP, unlike
other encryption which generally protects only a particular higher-level
protocol -- <a href="glossary.html#PGP">PGP</a> for mail,
<a href="glossary.html#SSH">SSH</a> for remote login,
<a href="glossary.html#SSL">SSL</a> for web work, and so on. This has
both advantages and disadvantages, discussed in our
<a href="ipsec.html#others">IPSEC section</a>
</p>

<p>
IPSEC can be used on any machine which does IP networking. Dedicated IPSEC
gateway machines can be installed wherever required to protect traffic. IPSEC
can also run on routers, on firewall machines, on various application servers,
and on end-user desktop or laptop machines.   
<p>
Three protocols are used</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="glossary.html#AH">AH</a> (Authentication Header) provides a packet-level authentication service</li>
  <li><a href="glossary.html#ESP">ESP</a> (Encapsulating Security Payload) provides encryption plus authentication</li>
  <li><a href="glossary.html#IKE">IKE</a> (Internet Key Exchange) negotiates connection parameters, including
    keys, for the other two</li>
</ul>
<p>
Our implementation has three main parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="glossary.html#KLIPS">KLIPS</a> (kernel IPSEC) implements AH, ESP, and packet handling within the
    kernel</li>
  <li><a href="glossary.html#Pluto">Pluto</a> (an IKE daemon) implements IKE, negotiating connections with other
    systems</li>
  <li>various scripts provide an adminstrator's interface to the
  machinery</li>
</ul>

<p>
IPSEC is optional for the current (version 4) Internet Protocol. FreeS/WAN
adds IPSEC to the Linux IPv4 network stack. Implementations of <a
href="glossary.html#ipv6.gloss">IP version 6</a> are required to include IPSEC.
Work toward integrating FreeS/WAN into the Linux IPv6 stack has
<a href="compat.html#ipv6">started</a>.</p>

<p>For more information on IPSEC, see our <a href="ipsec.html">IPSEC
protocols</a> section, our collection of <a href="web.html#ipsec.link">IPSEC links</a>
or the <a href="rfc.html">RFCs</a> which are the official definitions of these
protocols.</p>

<h3><a name="intro.interop">Interoperating with other IPSEC implementations</a></h3>

<p>IPSEC is designed to let different implementations work together. We
provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <a href="web.html#implement">list</a> of some other implementations</li>
  <li>information on <a href="interop.html">using FreeS/WAN with other
    implementations</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The VPN Consortium fosters cooperation among implementers and interoperability
among implementations. Their <a href="http://www.vpnc.org/">web site</a> has
much more information.

<h3><a name="applications">Applications of IPSEC</a></h3>

<p>
Because IPSEC operates at the network layer, it is remarkably flexible and
can be used to secure nearly any type of Internet traffic. Two applications,
however, are extremely widespread:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <a href="glossary.html#VPN">Virtual Private Network</a>, or VPN, allows multiple
    sites to communicate securely over an insecure Internet by encrypting all
    communication between the sites.</li>
  <li>"Road Warriors" connect to the office from home, or perhaps from a hotel
    somewhere</li>
</ul>

<p>
There is enough opportunity in these applications that vendors are flocking
to them. IPSEC is being built into routers, into firewall products, and into
major operating systems, primarily to support these applications. See our
<a href="web.html#implement">list</a> of implementations for details.
<p>
We support both of those applications, and various less common IPSEC applications
as well, but we also add one of our own:</p>
<ul>
  <li>opportunistic encryption, the ability to set up FreeS/WAN gateways so
    that any two of them can encrypt to each other, and will do so whenever
    packets pass between them.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an extension we are adding to the protocols. FreeS/WAN is the first
prototype implementation, though we hope other IPSEC implementations will
adopt the technique once we demonstrate it. See <a href="#goals">project
goals</a> below for why we think this is important.</p>

<p>A somewhat more detailed description of each of these applications is
below. Our <a href="config.html">setup</a> section will show you how to build each
of them.</p>

<h4><a name="makeVPN">Using secure tunnels to create a VPN</a></h4>

<p>
A VPN, or <strong>V</strong>irtual <strong>P</strong>rivate
<strong>N</strong>etwork lets two networks communicate securely when the only
connection between them is over a third network which they do not trust.</p>

<p>The method is to put a security gateway machine between each of the
communicating networks and the untrusted network. The gateway machines encrypt
packets entering the untrusted net and decrypt packets leaving it, creating a
secure tunnel through it.</p>

<p>If the cryptography is strong, the implementation is careful, and the
administration of the gateways is competent, then one can reasonably trust the
security of the tunnel. The two networks then behave like a single large
private network, some of whose links are encrypted tunnels through untrusted
nets.</p>

<p>Actual VPNs are often more complex. One organisation may have fifty branch
offices, plus some suppliers and clients, with whom it needs to communicate
securely. Another might have 5,000 stores, or 50,000 point-of-sale devices.
The untrusted network need not be the Internet. All the same issues arise on a
corporate or institutional network whenever two departments want to
communicate privately with each other.</p>

<p>Administratively, the nice thing about many VPN setups is that large parts
of them are static. You know the IP addresses of most of the machines
involved. More important, you know they will not change on you. This
simplifies some of the admin work. For cases where the addresses do change,
see the next section.</p>

<h4><a name="road.intro">Road Warriors</a></h4>

<p>
The prototypical "Road Warrior" is a traveller connecting to home base from
a laptop machine. Administratively, most of the same problems arise for a
telecommuter connecting from home to the office, especially if the
telecommuter does not have a static IP address.</p>

<p>For purposes of this document:</p>
<ul>
  <li>anyone with a dynamic IP address is a "Road Warrior".</li>
  <li>any machine doing IPSEC processing is a "gateway". Think of the
    single-user road warrior machine as a gateway with a degenerate subnet
    (one machine, itself) behind it.</li>
</ul>
<p>
These require somewhat different setup than VPN gateways with static addresses
and with client systems behind them, but are basically not problematic.</p>

<p>
There are some difficulties which appear for some road warrior connections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Road Wariors who get their addresses via DHCP may have a problem.
    FreeS/WAN can quite happily build and use a tunnel to such an address, but
    when the DHCP lease expires, FreeS/WAN does not know that. The tunnel
    fails, and the only recovery method is to tear it down and re-build
  it.</li>
  <li>If Network Address Translation (NAT) is applied between the two IPSEC
    Gateways, this breaks IPSEC. IPSEC authenticates packets on an end-to-end
    basis, to ensure they are not altered en route. NAT rewrites packets as
    they go by. See our <a href="firewall.html#NAT">firewalls</a> document for details.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In most situations, however, FreeS/WAN supports road warrior connections
just fine.</p>

<h4><a name="opp.intro">Opportunistic encryption</a></h4>

<p>
One of the reasons we are working on FreeS/WAN is that it gives us the
opportunity to add what we call opportuntistic encryption. This means that any
two FreeS/WAN gateways will be able to encrypt their traffic, <em>even if the two
gateway administrators have had no prior contact and neither system has any
preset information about the other</em>.  We hope this will go some distance
toward creating a secure Internet, an environment where message privacy is the
default. See our <a href="politics.html">history and politics of cryptography</a>
section for discussion.</p>
<p>
Both systems pick up the authentication information they need from the
<a href="glossary.html#DNS.gloss">DNS</a> (domain name service), the service
they already use to look up IP addresses. Of course the administrators must
put that information in the DNS, and must set up their gateways with
opportunistic encryption enabled.

Once that is done, everything is automatic. The gateways look for
opportunities to encrypt, and encrypt whatever they can. Whether they also
accept unencrypted communication is a policy decision the administrator can
make.</p>
<p>
A draft document giving most of the details of how we plan to implement
this has been posted to the mailing list. See <a href=#applied>links</a> below.</p>
<p>
Only one current product we know of implements a form of opportunistic
encryption. <a href="web.html#ssmail">Secure sendmail</a> will automatically encrypt
server-to-server mail transfers whenever possible.</p>

<h3><a name="types">The need to authenticate gateways</a></h3>

<p>A complication, which applies to any type of connection -- VPN, Road
Warrior or opportunistic -- is that a secure connection cannot be created
magically. <em>There must be some mechanism which enables the gateways to
reliably identify each other.</em> Without this, they cannot sensibly trust
each other and cannot create a genuinely secure link.</p>

<p>Any link they do create without some form of
<a href="glossary.html#authentication">authentication</a> will be vulnerable
to a <a href="glossary.html#middle">man-in-the-middle attack</a>. If
<a href="glossary.html#alicebob">Alice and Bob</a> are the people creating the
connection, a villian who can re-route or intercept the packets can pose as
Alice while talking to Bob and pose as Bob
while talking to Alice. Alice and Bob then both talk to the man in the middle,
thinking they are talking to each other, and the villain gets everything sent
on the bogus &quot;secure&quot; connection.</p>

<p>There are two ways to build links securely, both of which exclude the
man-in-the middle:</p>
<ul>
  <li>with <strong>manual keying</strong>, Alice and Bob share a secret key
    (which must be transmitted securely, perhaps in a note or via PGP or SSH)
    to encrypt their messages. For FreeS/WAN, such keys are stored in the <a
    href="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html">ipsec.conf(5)</a> file. Of course, if
    an enemy gets the key, all is lost.</li>
  <li>with <strong>automatic keying</strong>, the two systems authenticate
    each other and negotiate their own secret keys. The keys are automatically
    changed periodically.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Automatic keying is much more secure, since if an enemy gets one key only
messages between the previous re-keying and the next are exposed. It is
therefore the usual mode of operation for most IPSEC deployment, and the mode
we use in our setup examples. FreeS/WAN does support manual keying for special
circumstanes. See this <a href="config.html#prodman">section</a>.

<p>
For automatic keying, the two systems must authenticate each other during
the negotiations. There is a choice of methods for this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <strong>shared secret</strong> provides authentication. If Alice and
    Bob are the only ones who know a secret and Alice recives a message which
    could not have been created without that secret, then Alice can safely
    believe the message came from Bob.</li>
  <li>a <a href="glossary.html#public">public key</a> can also provide authentication. If
    Alice receives a message signed with Bob's private key (which of course
    only he should know) and she has a trustworthy copy of his public key (so
    that she can verify the signature), then she can safely believe the
    message came from Bob.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Public key techniques are much preferable, for reasons discussed
<a href="config.html#choose">later</a>, and will be used in all our
setup examples. FreeS/WAN does also support auto-keying with shared secret
authentication.
See this <a href="config.html#prodsecrets">section</a>.</p>


<h2><a name="project">The FreeS/WAN project</a></h2>

<h3><a name="goals">Project goals</a></h3>

<p>
Our overall goal in FreeS/WAN is to make the Internet more secure and more
private.</p>
<p>
Our IPSEC implementation supports VPNs and Road Warriors of course. Those
are important applications. Many users will want FreeS/WAN to build corporate
VPNs or to provide secure remote access.
<p>
However, our goals in building it go beyond that. We are trying to help
<strong>build security into the fabric of the Internet</strong> so that anyone
who choses to communicate securely can do so, as easily as they can do anything
else on the net.</p>

<p>More detailed objectives are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>help make IPSEC widespread by providing an implementation with no
    restrictions:
    <ul>
      <li>freely available in source code under the <a href="glossary.html#GPL">GNU General
        Public License</a></li>
      <li>running on a range of readily available hardware</li>
      <li>not subject to US or other nations' <a href="politics.html#exlaw">export
        restrictions</a>.<br>
        Note that in order to avoid <em>even the appearance</em> of being
        subject to those laws, the project cannot accept software
        contributions -- <em>not even one-line bug fixes</em> -- from US
        residents or citizens.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>provide a high-quality IPSEC implementation for Linux
    <ul>
      <li>portable to all CPUs Linux supports: <a href="compat.html#CPUs">(current
        list)</a></li>
      <li>interoperable with other IPSEC implementations: <a
        href="interop.html">(current list)</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>extend IPSEC to do <a href="glossary.html#carpediem">opportunistic encryption</a> so
    that
    <ul>
      <li>any two systems can secure their communications without a pre-arranged connection</li>
      <li>secure connections can be the default, falling back to unencrypted connections only
         if:
       <ul>
        <li><em>both</em> the partner is not set up to co-operate on securing the connection
        <li><em>and</em> your policy allows insecure connections
       </ul> 
      <li>a significant fraction of all Internet traffic is encrypted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
If we can get opportunistic encryption implemented and widely deployed, then it becomes
impossible for even huge well-funded agencies to monitor the net.

<h4><a name="munitions">The &quot;munitions&quot; archive of Linux crypto software</a></h4>

There is also an archive of Linux crypto software called &quot;munitions&quot;,
with its own mirrors in a number of countries. It includes FreeS/WAN,
though not always the latest version. Some of its sites are:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://munitions.vipul.net/">Germany</a>
<li><a href="http://munitions.iglu.cjb.net/">Italy</a>
<li><a href="http://munitions2.xs4all.nl/">Netherlands</a>
</ul>
<p>
Any of those will have a list of other &quot;munitions&quot; mirrors.

<h3><a name="archives">Archives of the project mailing list</a></h3>

Until quite recently, there was only one FreeS/WAN mailing list, and archives
of it were:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.sandelman.ottawa.on.ca/linux-ipsec">Canada</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.nexial.com">Holland</a></li>
</ul>
The two archives use completely different search engines. You might want to
try both.</p>
<p>
More recently we have expanded to five lists, each with its own archive.

<h2><a name="products">Products containing FreeS/WAN</a></h2>

<p>
Unfortunately the <a href="politics.html#exlaw">export laws</a> of some countries
restrict the distribution of strong cryptography. FreeS/WAN is therefore not
in the standard Linux kernel and not in all CD or web distributions.</p>

<h3><a name="distwith">Full Linux distributions</a></h3>

<p>FreeS/WAN is included in various general-purpose Linux distributions from
countries (shown in brackets) with more sensible laws:</p>
<ul>
  <li>European versions of <a href="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE Linux</a> (Germany)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.conectiva.com">Conectiva</a> (Brazil)</li>
  <li>the server edition of <a href="http://www.corel.com">Corel</a> Linux (Canada)</li>
  <li>the <a href="http://www.pld.org.pl/">Polish(ed) Linux Distribution</a> (Poland)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.trustix.net/">Trustix Secure Linux</a> (Norway)
</ul>
<p>
For distributions which do not include FreeS/WAN and are not Redhat (which we
develop and test on), there is additional information in our
<a href="compatibility.html#otherdist">compatibility</a> section.</p>
<p>
We would appreciate hearing of other distributions using FreeS/WAN.</p>


<h3><a name="fw_dist">Firewall distributions</a></h3>

FreeS/WAN is also included in, or available for, more specialised distributions
intended for firewall and router applications:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.gibraltar.at/">Gibraltar</a> is based on Debian GNU/Linux.
   It is bootable directly from CD-ROM,
   usable on a machine without hard disk.
   <li>The <a href="http://www.linuxrouter.org/">Linux Router Project</a>
   produces a distribution that will boot from a single floppy. Charles
   Steinkuehler's LRP site provides 
   <a href="http://lrp.steinkuehler.net/Packages/ipsec1.5.htm">FreeS/WAN packaged for LRP</a>.
   <li><a href="http://www.astaro.com/products/index.html">Astaro Security Linux</a> includes FreeS/WAN.
    It has some web-based tools for managing the firewall that include FreeS/WAN configuration
    management.</li>
   <li><a href="http://www.linuxwall.de">Linuxwall</a>
</ul>
<p>
There are also several sets of scripts available for managing a firewall which is also acting as a
FreeS/WAN IPSEC gateway. See this
<a href="firewall.html#examplefw">list</a>. 
<p>
We would appreciate hearing of other specialised distributions using FreeS/WAN, or other
script sets.</p>

<h3><a name="turnkey">Firewall and VPN products</a></h3>

<p>Several vendors use FreeS/WAN as the IPSEC component of a turnkey firewall
or VPN product:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.lasat.com">LASAT SafePipe[tm]</a> series. is an
    IPSEC box based on an embedded MIPS running Linux with FreeS/WAN and a
    web-config front end. This company also host our freeswan.org web
  site.</li>
  <li><a href="www.rebel.com">Rebel.com</a>, makers of the Netwinder ARM Linux
    machine, have a new (mid-2000) division <a
    href="http://www.rebel.com/solutions/smb/rn-what.html">Rebel Networks</a>
    whose product uses FreeS/WAN.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.linuxmagic.com/vpn/index.html">Linux Magic</a> offer

  <li><a href="http://www.linuxcare.com">Linuxcare</a> have &quot;bootable business card&quot;
    usable as a recovery disk for broken Linux systems.
</ul>

<p>We would appreciate hearing of other products using FreeS/WAN.</p>

<h2><a name="docs">Documentation</a></h2>

<h3><a name="docformats">This HowTo, in multiple formats</a></h3>

<p>
FreeS/WAN documentation up to version 1.5 was available only in HTML.
Now we ship two formats:
<ul>
  <li>as HTML, one file for each doc section plus a global <a href="toc.html">Table of Contents</a>
  <li><a href="HowTo.html">one big HTML file</a> for easy searching</li>
</ul>
and provide a Makefile to generate other formats if required:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="HowTo.pdf">PDF</a></li>
  <li><a href="HowTo.ps">Postscript</a></li>
  <li><a href="HowTo.txt">ASCII text</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
The Makefile assumes the htmldoc tool is available. You can download it from
<a href="http://www.easysw.com">Easy Software</a>. You may need to get source
code and change some of the limits in <nobr><var>#define MAX_&lt;whatever&gt;</var></nobr>
statements near the end of its <var>config.h.in</var> file. Otherwise it core
dumps when those limits are exceeded on large files such as our glossary.html.</p> 
<p>
All formats should be available at the following websites:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.freeswan.org/doc.html">FreeS/WAN project</a>
<li><a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org">Linux Documentation Project</a>
</ul> 
<p>
The distribution tarball has only the two HTML formats.</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> If you need the latest doc version, for example to
see if anyone has managed to set up interoperation between FreeS/WAN and
whatever, then you should download the current snapshot. What is on the web
is documentation as of the last release. Snapshots have all changes I've
checked in to date.

<h3><a name="text">Other documents in the distribution</a></h3>

<p>Text files in the main distribution directory are README, INSTALL, CREDITS,
CHANGES, BUGS and COPYING.</p>

<p>
FreeS/WAN commands and library routines are documented in standard Unix
manual pages, accessible via the <var>man(1)</var> command. We also provide
them in HTML, accessible from this <a href="manpages.html">index</a>. In the event
of disagreement between this HowTo and the man pages, the man pages are more
likely correct since they are written by the implementers. Please report any
such inconsistency on the <a href="mail.html">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>The gmp (GNU multi-precision arithmetic) and Libdes (encryption)
libraries which we use each have their own documentation. You can find it
in those library directories.</p>

<h3><a name="howto">User-written HowTo information</a></h3>

<p>
Various user-written HowTo documents are available. The ones covering FreeS/WAN-to-FreeS/WAN
connections are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Jean-Francois Nadeau's <a href="http://jixen.tripod.com/">practical
    configurations</a> document</li>
   <li>Jens Zerbst's HowTo on <a href="http://dynipsec.tripod.com/">Using FreeS/WAN with dynamic IP
  addresses</a>.
  <li>an entry in Kurt Seifried's 
    <a href="http://www.securityportal.com/lskb/kben00000013.html">Linux Security Knowledge Base</a>. </li>
  <li>a section of David Ranch's <a
    href="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/LINUX/index-linux.html#trinityos">Trinity
    OS Guide</a></li>
  <li>a section in David Bander's book <a href="biblio.html#bander">Linux Security Toolkit</a>
  </ul>
<p>
User-wriiten HowTo material may be <strong>especially
helpful if you need to interoperate with another IPSEC implementation</strong>. We have
neither the equipment nor the manpower to test such configurations. Users seem
to be doing an admirable job of filling the gaps.</p>
<ul>
<li>list of user-written <a href="interop.html#otherpub">interoperation HowTos</a> in our interop document
</ul>
<p>
Check what version of FreeS/WAN user-written documents cover. The software is
under active development and the current version may be significantly
different from what an older document describes.</p>

<h3><a name="applied">Papers on FreeS/WAN</a></h3>
<p>
Two design documents show current team thinking on new developments:
<ul>
<li><a href="opportunism.spec">Opportunistic Encryption</a> by technical lead Henry Spencer
and Pluto programmer Hugh Redelemeier
<li><a href="klips2.spec">KLIPS II Design</a> by kernel programmer Richard Guy Briggs
</ul>
Both documents are works in progress and frequently revised. The most recent versions can
be found either in FreeS/WAN snapshots or on the <a href="mail.html">design mailing list</a>.
Comments should go to that list.

<p>
A number of papers giving further background on FreeS/WAN, or exploring its
future or its applications, are also available:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Both Henry and Richard gave talks on FreeS/WAN at the 2000 <a
    href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org">Ottawa Linux Symposium</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>Richard's <a
        href="http://www.conscoop.ottawa.on.ca/rgb/freeswan/ols2k/">slides</a></li>
      <li>Henry's paper</li>
      <li>MP3 audio of their talks is available from the <a href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org/">conference page</a>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><cite>Moat: A Virtual Private Network Appliances and Services
    Platform</cite> is a paper about large-scale (a few 100 links) use of
    FreeS/WAN in a production application at AT&amp;T research. It is
    available in Postscript or PDF from co-author Steve Bellovin's <a
    href="http://www.research.att.com/~smb/papers/index.html">papers list
    page</a>.</li>
  <li>One of the Moat co-authors, John Denker, has also written
    <ul>
      <li>a <a
        href="http://www.quintillion.com/fdis/moat/ipsec+routing/">proposal</a>
        for how future versions of FreeS/WAN might interact with routing
        protocols</li>
      <li>a <a
        href="http://www.quintillion.com/fdis/moat/wishlist.html">wishlist</a>
        of possible new features</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
 <li>Bart Trojanowski's web page has a draft design for
   <a href="http://www.jukie.net/~bart/linux-ipsec/">hardware acceleration</a> of FreeS/WAN
 <li>Feczak Szabolcs' <a href="http://feczo.koli.kando.hu/vpn/">thesis</a>, in Hungarian
</ul>
<p>
Several of these provoked interesting discussions on the mailing lists, worth
searching for in the <a href="mail.html#archive">archives</a>.
