This directory contains almost obsolete test scripts to excercise many of the
different combinations of connections that can be formed with IPSec.

The 'ji' sub-directory contains very out-of-date test scripts that are
here for historical purposes only.

The 100, 103, 105, 110 and west sub-directories contain scripts to be run
on the sub-directory-named SG (Security Gateway) for interoperating with
the script-named SG.  Many parameters will have to be customised for
your site.
