%description
The debug memory allocation or "dmalloc" library has been designed as
a drop in replacement for the system's `malloc', `realloc', `calloc',
`free' and other memory management routines while providing powerful
debugging facilities configurable at runtime.  These facilities
include such things as memory-leak tracking, fence-post write
detection, file/line number reporting, and general logging of
statistics.  It also provides support for the debugging of threaded
programs.  Releases and documentation available online.
