0.9.9

Erik Andersen:
    o   A bunch of doc updates.  Major update to the working
	apps list.
    o   Added a configurator script (extra/Configs/uClibc_config_fix.pl)
	which can simplify configuring uClibc.
    o   Fixed setjmp/longjmp on x86,arm,powerpc,mips,and sparc.
	Hitting ^C in ash kills client apps now, not ash. 
    o   Reworked signal handling code so it now passes POSIX 
	conformance tests.
    o   Fixed sleep and usleep to work correctly when
	interrupted by signals.
    o   Made getopt behave the same when staticly linking
	as when dynamicly linking.  It was using different
	implementations depending on how apps were linked.
    o   Added missing inttypes.h header file
    o   Eliminate all C++ style comments from header files
    o   Support statvfs and statfs
    o   Support getmntent_r
    o   Scandir and scandir64 were calling malloc without
	checking for ENOMEM
    o   Fixed stpcpy function declaration
    o   Many large file support improvements.
    o   Fixed fcntl to work when DOLFS is enabled
    o   Fixed termios code to do the Right Thing(tm)
    o   Allow regex to be excluded at compile time
    o   Implemented mempcpy
    o   Build ldd and readelf for the target system and for the 
	host system
    o   Fix several cases where get-needed-libgcc-objects.sh
	could fail, breaking the shared uClibc library.
    o   Include all shared library loader objects into a
	single C file, thereby reducing its size further.
    o   Reworked the shared library linking process to be more 
	flexible so that gcc and ld can more easily be built to
	target uClibc library.
    o   Better error checking in the Makefiles.  Be more pedantic
	about tar, chmod, etc to avoid system dependent failures.
    o   We can now autodetect the target architecture
    o   Hide references to wchar_t so GNU autoconf
	configure scripts won't get confused and try to 
	enable wide char support. 
    o   Fixed stdio.h so apps can use varargs.h if they want to.
    o   Added brk/sbrk support for ARM, powerpc, mips, and sparc
	and set them to default to the much faster brk using malloc
    o   Added missing syscalls: get_kernel_syms, fcntl64,
	fdatasync, sched_setparam, sched_getparam,
	sched_setscheduler, sched_getscheduler,
	sched_get_priority_max, sched_get_priority_min,
	sched_rr_get_interval, sigaltstack, sendfile, 
	pivot_root, sigsuspend, setfsuid, and setfsgid
    o   Force DOPIC be true when HAVE_SHARED is true.
    o   Fixed hstrerror()
    o   Implemented gethostent(), sethostent(), and endhostent()
    o   Added arch specific support so that sparc and mips actually 
	compile and work
Miles Bader:
    o   Fixes for the v850 architecture: crt0, setjmp, 
	arch autodetection, etc.
    o   Fixed `make install' to not build ldso stuff on
	non-shared-library systems.
Michael E Brown:
    o   Allow the gcc wrapper to support setting DEVEL_PREFIX
	and BUILD_DIR at runtime (no more need to recompile).
M. R. Brown and Erik Andersen:
    o   Fixed the SH port so it now works.  Tested and shown
	working on an SH4 Dreamcast system.
Kim Heino:
    o   Made 'make clean' remove generated bits/syscall.h
David McCullough:
    o   SH architecture updates.  Added brk, sbrk,
    o   Fixed simple malloc to work on systems with an MMU
    o   Taught getutent to return NULL if utmp doesn't exist. 
    o   Added insque/remque support
    o   Fixed DNS resolver version number so apps won't get
	confused and use the wrong API.
    o   Added Config selectable shadow password support
Yoshinori Sato
    o   Contributed support for the Hitach H8/300H architecture 
Cédric Schieli:
    o   Add support for inet_netof, inet_lnaof, inet_makeaddr 
	and hstrerror.             
David Schleef:
    o   Added libstrip, a nifty script to automagically
	strip unneeded content from the uClibc shared 
	libraries.
Martin Sieper
    o   Added getw() and putw()
    o   Added missing header files -- lastlog.h, sgtty.h, 
	netipx/ipx.h, sys/perm.h
Stefan Soucek:
    o   Add rcmd support, i.e. rsh, rlogin, etc.
    o   Fix rcmd to avoid alloca, which is dangerous
	on mmu-less systems
spudmonkey@racsa.co.cr:
    o   Eliminate a buffer overflow in the shared library loader
Brian Stafford:
    o   Enable support for Unix98 PTYs, and add option
	to disable old style PTYs.
