<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

<a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a> (aka µClibc/pronounced yew-see-lib-see)
is a C library for embedded Linux systems. It is much smaller then the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library</a>, but
nearly all applications supported by glibc also work perfectly with uClibc.
Porting applications from glibc to uClibc typically involves just recompiling
the source code. uClibc supports standard Linux architectures (such as x86,
strongArm, and powerpc), and also supports 
<a href="http://www.uclinux.org">MMU-less (also known as µClinux)</a>
architectures such as the Coldfire, Dragonball, and ARM7TDMI micro-controllers.
If you are building an embedded Linux system and you find that glibc is
eating up too much space, you should consider using uClibc.  If you are
building a huge fileserver with 12 Terabytes of storage, then using
glibc may be a better choice...

<p>

<p>
uClibc is maintained by 
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/erik.html">Erik Andersen</a>
and is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>
.  This license allows you to make closed source commercial applications using 
uClibc (Please consider sharing some of the money you make ;-).  You do not need 
to give away all your source code just because you use uClibc and/or run on Linux.

    <li> <b>4 February 2002, uClibc 0.9.9 Released!</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate
    availability of uClibc 0.9.9.  With this release,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/uClibc-apps.html">just about 
    everything we have tested now compiles and runs</a>.  In fact,
    there are now so many programs on the working application list that 
    rather than continue to add to this list, from now on we 
    will only be adding applications to the <em>not working list</em>.  Most applications 
    on the <em>not working list</em> either require pthreads, or require 
    wide-character support.  Work on wide-character support is
    well underway, and will hopefully be moving into CVS in the next week or
    two.  Full pthreads support and rentrancy are on the TODO list
    and are expected to be complete in the next couple of months.
    <p>
    Another very nice change is that we can now build full GNU
    toolchains (binutils/gcc) that target uClibc.  This brings
    full C++ support to uClibc.  A C++ toolchain is currently being
    tested, and will be publicly released in the next couple of days,
    so stay tuned.
    <p>
    The <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a
    href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/uClibc-0.9.9.tar.bz2">Source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/">here</a>.
    <p>
    One final bit on news -- as some of you may have noticed, uclibc.org 
    has been a bit overloaded and somewhat slow recently.  The server should 
    be getting colocated tomorrow, which will eliminate the speed problem.  
    During the move, there may be some temporary disruption of service...
    <p>
    Have Fun!

    <p>
    <li> <b>22 December 2001, uClibc 0.9.8 Released!</b>
    <br>

    After many months of initial development, we are pleased to announce the
    release of uClibc 0.9.8.  This release should be quite solid, and is very
    usable.  This also, hopefully, marks a transition from a slow incubation
    phase to a more methodical release cycle.  From now one, there should be
    approximately one release per month.
    <p>
    The source code for this release is available
	<a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/">here</a>.

	Do you like uClibc?  Do you need support?  Do you need some feature
	added to uClibc?  Then why not help out?  We are happy to accept
	donations, provide support contracts, and implement funded feature
	requests.  Additionally, uClibc is looking for corporate sponsors to
	assist development, pay for bandwidth, and help with hardware
	donations, especially donations of hardware for non-Intel
	architectures.  Click here to help support uClibc and/or request

    TODO

<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">


Here are a few things on the TODO list:
<ul>
    <li> Shared library support for all supported architectures.
	We now have our own ld.so, but it needs to be ported to
	support each architecture. 
    <li> Shared library support for mmu-less systems.  This is
	very doable (think of C++ vtables for example), but will
	take some work.
    <li> Someone (hopefully) needs to volunteer to take the
	<a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/test/">LSB Test Suite</a>,
	pull out the C library testing stuff, and convert it
	(perl script, by hand, I don't care how) into a form
	that is usable without having it take over your entire
	system (i.e. similar to what is currently in the uClibc
	test suite).  This will be <em>enormously</em> helpful!
    <li> other things as I think of them.
