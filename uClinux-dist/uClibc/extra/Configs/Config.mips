WARNINGS=-Wall

# Note that the kernel source you use to compile with should be the same as the
# Linux kernel you run your apps on.  uClibc doesn't even try to achieve binary
# compatibility across kernel versions.  So don't expect, for example, uClibc
# compiled with Linux kernel 2.0.x to implement lchown properly, since 2.0.x
# can't do that. Similarly, if you compile uClibc vs Linux 2.4.x kernel headers,
# but then run on Linux 2.0.x, lchown will be compiled into uClibc, but won't
# work at all.  You have been warned.

# Set this to `false' if your CPU doesn't have a memory management unit (MMU).
# Set it to `true' otherwise.

# Set this to `false' if you don't have/need basic floating point support
# support in libc (strtod, printf, scanf).  Set it to `true' otherwise.
# If this is not true, then libm will not be built.
HAS_FLOATING_POINT = true

# Set to `true' if you want the math library to contain the full set
# of C99 math library features.  Costs an extra 35k or so on x86. 
DO_C99_MATH = false

# Set this to `false' if you don't have/need "(unsigned) long long int" support.
# Set it to `true' otherwise.
# Affects *printf and *scanf functions.
# Also omits strto(u)ll, and (u)lltostr from the library if `false'.

# Set this to 'false if you don't need shadow password support.
HAS_SHADOW = false

# Set this to `false' if you don't have/need locale support; `true' otherwise.
# Note: Currently only affects the ctype functions.  You must also generate
# a locale file for anything but the C locale.  See directory extra/locale for
# a utility to do so.  Also see the following option.

# This specifies which malloc implementation is used.
# "malloc-simple" is very, very small, but is also very, very dumb 
# and does not try to make good use of memory or clean up after itself.
#
# "malloc" on the other hand is a bit bigger, but is pretty smart thereby
# minimizing memory wastage and reusing already allocated memory.  This 
# can be lots faster and safer IMHO.
#
# "malloc-930716" is from libc-5.3.12 and was/is the standard gnu malloc.
# It is actually smaller than "malloc", at least on i386.  Right now, it
# only works on i386 (and maybe m68k) because it needs sbrk.
#MALLOC = malloc-simple
#MALLOC = malloc

# If you want to collect common syscall code into one function, set to this to

# The idea came from the implementation in dietlibc.
# At present, only affects i386.

# Of course, if you only staticly link, leave this on, since it will
# only be included in your apps if you use regular expressions.

# Protocol: IP version 6, enable this.  This is off by default.

# applications may need this disabled.  For most current programs, 
# you can generally leave this true.

# Enable this if /dev/pts is on a devpts or devfs file system.  Both

# have to recompile if you change this value...
