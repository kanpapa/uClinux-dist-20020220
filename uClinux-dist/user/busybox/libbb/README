libbb is BusyBox's utility library.  This all used to be in a single file
(utility.c to be specific).  When I split utility.c up to create libbb, I did
not carefully fix up the copyright and licensing information.  I'll do that for
the next release.

For now, justtrust me that a bunch of people have worked on this stuff, 
and it is all GPL'ed.
