release 0.4 - initial public release

release 0.5 - added cacheing, removed compiler warning on linux PPC

release 0.6 - TCP handling: close socket and return to connect state if we 
              can't read the first byte. This corrects a problem seen very 
              occasionally where dnsmasq would loop using all available CPU.

	      Added a patch from Cris Bailiff <c.bailiff@e-secure.com.au>
	      to set SO_REUSEADDR on the tcp socket which stops problems when
              dnsmasq is restarted and old connections still exist.

	      Stopped claiming in doc.html that smail is the default Debian
	      mailer, since it isn't any longer. (Pointed out by
	      David Karlin <dkarlin@coloradomtn.edu>)

release 0.7   Create a pidfile at /var/run/dnsmasq.pid

	      Extensive armouring against "poison packets" courtesy of
              Thomas Moestl <tmoestl@gmx.net>

	      Set sockaddr.sa_family on outgoing address, patch from
	      David Symonds <xoxus@usa.net>

              Patch to clear cache on SIGHUP 
	      from Jason L. Wagner <nialscorva@yahoo.com> 

	      Fix bad bug resulting from not initialising value-result	
	      address-length parameter to recvfrom() and accept() - it
	      worked by luck before!

release 0.95  Major rewrite: remove calls to gethostbyname() and talk
              directly to the upstream server(s) instead.
              This has many advantages.
              (1) Dnsmasq no longer blocks during long lookups.
              (2) All query types are handled now, (eg MX) not just internet
                  address queries. Addresses are cached, all other
                  queries are forwarded directly.
              (3) Time-to-live data from upstream server is read and
                  used by dnsmasq to purge entries from the cache.
              (4) /etc/hosts is still read and its contents served (unless 
	          the -h option is given).
              (5) Dnsmasq can get its upstream servers from
                  a file other than /etc/resolv.conf (-r option) this allows
                  dnsmasq to serve names to the machine it is running
                  on (put nameserver 127.0.0.1 in /etc/resolv.conf and
                  give dnsmasq the option -r /etc/resolv.dnsmasq)
              (6) Dnsmasq will re-read it's servers if the
                  modification time of resolv.conf changes. Along with
                  4 above this allows nameservers to be set
		  automatically by ppp or dhcp.	 

              A really clever NAT-like technique allows the daemon to have lots
              of queries in progress, but still remain very lightweight.
	      Dnsmasq has a small footprint and normally doesn't allocate
              any more memory after start-up. The NAT-like forwarding was
              inspired by a suggestion from Eli Chen <eli@routefree.com>

release 0.96  Fixed embarrasing thinko in cache linked-list code.
                             
release 0.98  Some enhancements and bug-fixes. 
              Thanks to "Denis Carre" <denis.carre@laposte.net> and Martin 
              Otte <otte@essc.psu.edu>	
              
	      (1) Dnsmasq now always sets the IP source address
                  of its replies correctly. Older versions would not always
                  do this on multi-homed and IP aliased hosts, which violates 
                  the RFC.
              (2) Dnsmasq no longer crashes if a server loop is created
	          (ie dnsmasq is told to use itself as an upstream server.)
                  Now it just logs the problem and doesn't use the bad 
                  server address.
              (3) Dnsmasq should now forward (but not cache) inverse queries 
                  and server status queries; this feature has not been tested.
              (4) Don't write the pid file when in non-daemon mode.
	      (5) Create the pid file mode 644, rather then 666 (!).
              (6) Generate queries to upstream nameservers with unpredictable
                  ids, to thwart DNS spoofers.
              (7) Dnsmasq no longer forwards queries when the 
	          "recursion desired" bit is not set in the header.
	      (8) Fixed getopt code to work on compliers with unsigned char.
              
release 0.991 Added -b flag: when set causes dnsmasq to always answer
	      reverse queries on the RFC 1918 private IP space itself and
              never forward them to an upstream server. If the name is not in
	      /etc/hosts, dnsmasq replies with the dotted-quad address.
              
              Fixed a bug which stopped dnsmasq working on a box with
              two or more interfaces with the same IP address. 

              Fixed cacheing of CNAMEs. Previously, a CNAME which pointed
              to  a name with many A records would not have all the addresses
              returned when being answered from the cache.

	      Thanks to "Steve Hardy" <s.a.hardy@connectux.com> for his input 
              on these fixes.

              Fixed race which could cause dnsmasq to miss the second of
              two closely-spaced updates of resolv.conf (Thanks to Eli Chen
              for pointing this out.)

	      Fixed a bug which could cause dnsmasq to fail to cache some
              dns names.

release 0.992 Small change to memory allocation so that names in /etc/hosts
              don't use cache slots. Also make "-c 0" flag meaningfully 
              disable caching completely.
