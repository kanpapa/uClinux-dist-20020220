<TITLE> Dnsmasq - a DNS forwarder for NAT firewalls.</TITLE>

<H1 ALIGN=center>Dnsmasq</H1> 
Dnsmasq is small utility designed to provide DNS (domain name) services to a 
small network connected to the internet via a NAT (network address translation,
AKA ip-masquerade) firewall and a modem, cable-modem or ADSL connection. 
<P>
Since a NAT firewall will pass DNS queries it's perfectly possible for all the
machines on such a network to be configured to talk directly to the ISP's name
server, and the HOWTO recommends doing exactly that. The advantages of
using dnsmasq instead are:
<DIR>

<LI> 
The dns configuration of machines behind the firewall is simple and
doesn't depend on the details of the ISP's dns servers
<LI>
Clients which try to do DNS lookups while  a modem link to the
internet is down will time out immediately.
</LI>
<LI>
Dnsmasq will serve names from the /etc/hosts file on the firewall
machine: If the names of local machines are there, then they can all
be addressed without having to maintain /etc/hosts on each machine.
</LI>
<LI>
Dnsmasq caches internet addresses (A records) and adrress-to-name
mappings (PTR records), reducing the load on upsteam servers and
improving performance (especially on modem connections). From version
0.95 the cache honours Time-to-live information and expires old
records as they expire.
</LI>
<LI>
Dnsmasq can be configured to automatically pick up the addresses of
it's upstream nameservers from ppp or dhcp configuration. It will
automatically reload this information of it changes. This facility
will be of particular interest to maintainer of Linux firewall
distributions since it allows dns configuration to be made automatic.
</LI>
</DIR>

<P>
Dnsmasq has one further feature; it can be configured to return an MX record 
for the firewall host. This makes it easy to configure the mailer on the local 
machines to forward all mail to the central mailer on the firewall host. Never 
lose root messages from your machines again!

<H2>Download.</H2>

Download dsmasq <A HREF="http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/"> here</A>. The tarballs includes this documentation, source, and a binary 
linked against glibc2.1 for Linux-i386.
There are also i386 .debs.
<P>
A very simple INSTALL script is provided which will compile dnsmasq
if necessary and install the binary and man page.
<P>
If you wish to compile the source yourself, the following command is enough.

<PRE>
gcc -o dnsmasq dnsmasq.c
</PRE>

<H2>Installation.</H2>

Dnsmasq should be run on your firewall machine (the machine with the modem connection to your ISP.)

Put the binary in <TT>/usr/local/sbin/dnsmasq</TT> (The INSTALL script will do this) and arrange for it
to be started at boot time.

Note that dnsmasq needs to run as root, since it binds priveliged ports. It
logs problems using the syslog facility as a daemon.
<P>
<H2>Configuration.</H2>
<H3>Simplest.</H3>
Put the address(es) of your ISP's DNS server(s) in /etc/resolv.conf on the 
firewall machine, and the names and internal network addresses of all your 
machines in /etc/hosts on the firewall machine.
 All the other machines on 
your network can simply have their own name and localhost in <TT>/etc/hosts
</TT> and 
should have the address of the firewall machine on the internal network as
the only nameserver in <TT>/etc/resolv.conf</TT>. For windows machines use the 
network applet in the control panel to set the address of the DNS server as the address of the firewall machine.
<H3>Cacheing for firewall.</H3>
If you want dnsmasq to cache DNS queries for the firewall machine also, simply 
put "nameserver 127.0.0.1" in /etc/resolv.conf. Put the real nameservers in 
another file, say /etc/resolv.dnsmasq, and use the -r command line flag to
make dnsmasq read that instead of /etc/resolv.conf.
<h3>Automatic DNS server configuration with PPP.</h3>
Later versions of pppd have an option "usepeerdns" which instructs it to write a file containing
the address(es) of the dns severs in /etc/ppp/resolv.conf. Configure dnsmasq
as above with "nameserver 127.0.0.1" in /etc/resolv.conf and run dnsmasq 
with to option "-r /etc/ppp/resolv.conf"
<h3>Automatic DNS server configuration with DHCP.</h3>
On Debian, dhcpcd writes a nameserver file in /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf, with a link to that at /etc/resolv.conf. Remove the link at /etc/resolv.conf and configure 
dnsmasq as for PPP, but with the option "-r /etc/dhcpc/resolv.conf".  
For other DHCP clients and other distros, you might have to patch the source of your DHCP client to achieve the same effect.



<H2>Setting up a mailhub.</H2>
If you generate mail on the machines attached to your private network, you may
 be interested in the MX record feature of dnsmasq. This allows you to have all
 the machines on your network use your firewall machine as a "smarthost" and 
deliver mail to it. The details of how to set this up are highly dependent on
your mailer, system and distribution. (On Debian GNU/Linux, using the 
smail mailer, there's an option in the smailconfig program to set up this 
configuration.) The only thing that's relevant to dnsmasq is that the mailer 
needs to be able to interogate the DNS and find an MX record for your mailhub.
By starting dnsmasq with the -m option

<PRE>
dnsmasq -m mailhubname
</PRE>

you instruct dnsmasq to server an MX record for <TT>mailhubname</TT>. 
The MX record always 
points to the machine on which dnsmasq is running, so mail delivered to that
name will get sent to the mailer on your firewall machine.

<H2>Other configuration details.</H2>
dnsmasq writes its process-id into /var/run/dnsmasq.pid at startup. 
<P>
Sending SIGHUP to the dnsmasq process will cause it to empty it's cache and 
re-load /etc/hosts.
<P> The -h option suppresses use of /etc/hosts.


<H2>License.</H2>
Dnsmasq is distributed under the GPL. See the file COPYING in the distribution 
for details.
