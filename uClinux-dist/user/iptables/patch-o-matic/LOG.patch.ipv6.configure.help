CONFIG_IP6_NF_FILTER
LOG target support
CONFIG_IP6_NF_TARGET_LOG
  This option adds a `LOG' target, which allows you to create rules in
  any ip6tables table which records the packet header to the syslog.

  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
