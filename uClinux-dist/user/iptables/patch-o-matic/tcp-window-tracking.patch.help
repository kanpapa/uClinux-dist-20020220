Status: proven to be quite stable, but still experimental

This patch is an implementation of TCP connection tracking according
to the article 'Real Stateful TCP Packet Filtering in IP Filter' by
Guido van Rooij [1].  It contains the new TCP connection tracking with
support to handle already established connections.  Window scaling
support is added.
