CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TOS
TIME patch support
CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_TIME
  This option adds a `time' match, which allows you to create rules in
  any iptables table wich will match packet arrival timestamp
  (arrival time at the machine which the netfilter is running on).

  If you say Y here, try iptables -m time --help for more information.
 
  If you want to compile it as a module, say M here and read
  Documentation/modules.txt.  If unsure, say `N'.
