<H2>The requested URL could not be retrieved</H2>
<HR>
<P>
The following URL could not be retrieved:
<A HREF="%U">%U</A>
<P>
Squid sent the following FTP command:
<blockquote><strong><pre>%f</pre></strong></blockquote>
and then received this reply
<blockquote><strong><pre>%F</pre></strong></blockquote>
<blockquote><strong><pre>%g</pre></strong></blockquote>
<P>
This might be caused by an FTP URL with an absolute path (which does
not comply with RFC 1738).  If this is the cause, then the file
can be found at <A HREF="%B">%B</A>.
</P>
