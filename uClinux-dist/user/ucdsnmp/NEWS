    - SMUX support has been reintegrated into the agent in a better way.
    - Many many others.

*4.0.1*
 New:
    - defVersion in snmp.conf supported.
 Fixes:
    - An option was accidentally turned on by default that shouldn't have been.
    - misc minor fixes.

*4.0*
 New:
    - SNMPv3 protocol support!!!
      (See the README.snmpv3, snmpusm(1), snmp.conf(5), snmpd.conf(5))
    - historic v2party support removed.
    - complete re-write of the agent.
    - The extensible AgentX protocol is in alpha-test mode.
      (to use, compile with the mib-module "agentx" or
      "agentx/master" or "agentx/client").

    - many other things we've forgotten.
    - code is ANSI C now, and requires a ANSI C compiler.

 API Changes:
    - A small change to the write functions in mib modules.
      (data passed in has already be BER-decoded and is a pointer to a 
      variable of the correct type).
    - The config_load_mib mib-module .h file directive is now
      obsolete.  Use REGISTER_MIB inside your init function instead.

*3.6.2*
 Fixes:
    - An important multi-session bug fix, especially needed for the
      SNMP perl module.
    - Many minor bug fixes.

*3.6.1*
 Fixes:
    - Minor last second fixes mostly.

*3.6*
 New:
    - All of the services for ucd-snmp have moved from the sites in
      ece.ucdavis.edu to ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu, including http, ftp,
      and the mailing lists.
    - The configure --help output has been greatly improved for better
      readability and has been broken into sections.
    - The agent's SMUX support has been greatly improved and should
      function with applications other than gated now.
    - The snmptrapd has been make extensible so you can call other
      programs and scripts when a trap has been received.
      (see snmptrapd.conf(5))
    - More configuration files have been created and can be used to
      specify defaults and configuration information to the various
      applications.  Run each command with -H to see what it understands.
      (see snmp_config(5), snmpd.conf(5), snmp.conf(5), snmptrapd.conf(5))
    - The configuration file parser looks in ~/.snmp by default as
      well, allowing each user to have his/her own setup files for the
      various applications.
    - The mib parser supports a variety of options dictating how
      strictly it parses mib files.
      (see snmpcmd.1 on "-P")
    - Debugging output with the -D flag now accepts a list of
      debugging information types to print.
      (see snmpcmd.1 on "-D")
    - Minimal multi-thread support using a modified version of the
      session API.
      (see snmp_sess_api(3))
    - persistent storage of information is possible from the agent's
      mib modules now.
      (see read_config(3))
    - The target mib has been implemented as an optional module.
    - More documentation has been written.
    - The recommended mib module API has changed slightly, but is
      backwards compatible as well.  See the AGENT.txt file for new
      documentation on how to write mib modules for the agent.

*3.5.1*

 Fixes:
    - Many bug fixes submitted by users and the ucd-snmp-coders.
    - v2party support in the agent has been fixed.
    - The UCD-SNMP-MIB is SMICng compliant and should work under HP OV better.
    - Most sections of the mibII tree are 64bit clean.

 Copyright:
    - Simplification.

*3.5*

 New:
    - agent/mibgroup directory reorganized hierarchically.
      - this may break the agent compilation with some compilers.
    - floats, doubles, counter64s, int64s, uint64s support via opaque types.
    - new modules: misc/ipfwacc.
    - use of dynamicly loadable modules now possible, but not fully supported.
    - New application command line flags:  -s, -S, -m MIBS, -M MIBDIRS.

      FreeBSD, SunOS (almost).

*3.4*

 Important:
    - the UCD-SNMP specific mib structure changed.
      - many of the table oids have changed location and have been renamed.
    - the View Based Access Control module was implemented in the agent.
      Therefore, the "community" snmpd.conf parameter no longer
      exists.  See the snmpd.conf file for how to control access via
      community names now.
    - The header file #defines have changed.  You may have to compile
      third party applications with -DCMU_COMPATIBLE (like perl-SNMP <= V1.7).
    - The parser is more strict about unlinked OIDs and end-of-comment
      conditions.  You may see problems in a few broken mibs that used
      to parse ok with the older parser.

 New:
    - dynamic library support:  configure with --enable-shared.
    - the beginnings of a Perl/Tk/SNMP mib browser: tkmib
    - all applications support -R for random oid-name lookups.
    - default mib list changes when you add or remove agent mib-groups.
    - debugging in the agent can be turned on and off using snmpsets.
    - a new mib module displays a list of all loaded mib modules.
    - the internal structure of the agent's mib modules is now hierarchical.
    - the agent looks for .conf files in both the lib/ and share/ directories.
    - more improvements/options to snmptable.
    - new vmstat module to report vmstat related information under linux.
    - a perl based mib2c translator to convert mib sections to C code templates.

 Fixes:
    - The code was run through purify for memory leaks and a few were found.
    - snmptrap sends to the correct default port of 162 again.

 Ports:
    - irix 6.2 support improved.
    - openbsd.
    - the host resources mib compiles on Solaris.

*3.3.1*

 New:
    - "make install" installs the library and header files.

 Fixes:
    - compilation on many architectures (sunos for example).
    - snmptrapd doesn't exit if v2party files don't exist.
    - host resources works a bit better (ie, it compiles) under solaris.
    

*3.3*

  Path changes:
    - the default paths to the installed mibs and snmpd.conf file have
      changed to /usr/local/share/snmp (set differently using --datadir).
    - the default path of the snmpd and snmptrapd have changed to
      /usr/local/sbin (set differently using --sbindir).

  New:
    - basic SNMPV2c support.  
      - Not fully tested (feedback please!), and not RFC compliant.
      - all apps require '-v 2c' for v2c and '-v 2p' for the older party code.
    - basic host-resources mib support for linux, and hpux.
    - All environment variables can be set with a preceding '+' for
        indicating additions to the default values.
    - mib modules cleaned up more and can be added and removed more easily.
    - mib modules have a new macro for callbacks when reading a .conf file.
    - apps command line interfaces have merged together for standardization.
    - the libsnmp library no longer forces printing of errors.
    - 2 new applications: snmpdelta and snmptable.
    - the mib parser caches mib directory scans for speed improvements.
    - snmptrapd is snmp-version multi-lingual.

  Ported:
    - irix should be more complete.
    - aix 4.1.5.
    - fixes for hpux 10.20.
    - linux 2.1.x support.
    - library and apps supported under 32bit windows systems.

  Fixes:
    - too numerous to mention.

*3.2*

  New:
    - Top level of the mib parser has been restructured
      - no longer reads 'mib.txt'
      - no longer reads everything (MIBS/MIBDIRS)
      - reads import clauses to load other required modules
      - new man page: mib_api.3
    - The agent has been completely restructured (modularized) to
      allow for easier extension via C code and requires no
      modification of the ucd-snmp distributed source code to add in
      new C coded mib modules.  See the README file in the
      agent/mibgroup subdirectory for details.  Modules are added and/or
      removed via configure options.
    - agent can send traps to multiple trap destinations.
