INTRODUCTION

  This package was originally based on the CMU 2.1.2.1 snmp code.  It
  has been greatly modified, restructured, enhanced and fixed.  It
  hardly looks the same as anything that CMU has ever released.

SUPPORTED ARCHITECTURES

  Please see the FAQ for this information.

  Please let us know if you compile it on other OS versions and it
  works for you so we can add them to the above list.

  Porting:  Please! read the PORTING file.

HELPING OUT

  This is a project worked on by people around the net.  We'd love
  your help, but please read the PORTING file first.  Also, subscribe
  to the ucd-snmp-coders list described below and mention what you're
  going to work on to make sure no one else is already doing so!
  You'll also need to keep up to date with the latest code snap shot,
  which can be obtained from CVS using the information found at
  http://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu/developer.html.

CODE UPDATE ANNOUNCEMENTS

  See the NEWS file and the ChangeLog file for details on what has
  changed between releases.

  We hate broadcasting announce messages to other mailing lists and
  newsgroups, so there is a mailing list set up to handle release
  announcements.  Any time we put new software out for ftp, we'll mail
  this fact to ucd-snmp-announce@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu.  See the
  MAILING LISTS section described below to sign up for these
  announcements.

  We will post new announcements on a very infrequent basis to the
  other channels (the other snmp mailing lists and newsgroups like
  comp.protocols.snmp), but only for major code revisions and not for
  bug-fix patches or small feature upgrades.

MAILING LISTS

  The lists:

    The following mailing lists have been created for your use:

      ucd-snmp-announce@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu  -- For announcements
         Subscribe to ucd-snmp-announce-request@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu

      ucd-snmp@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu           -- For usage discussions
         Subscribe to ucd-snmp-request@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu

      ucd-snmp-coders@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu    -- For development discussions
         Subscribe to ucd-snmp-coders-request@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu

      ucd-snmp-cvs@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu       -- For cvs update announcements
         Subscribe to ucd-snmp-cvs-request@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu

      ucd-snmp-bugs-mail@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu -- Where bug reports are sent.
         Subscribe to ucd-snmp-bugs-mail-request@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu

    The lists you definitely want to subscribe to is the
    ucd-snmp-announce@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu list and the
    ucd-snmp@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu list.

  Subscribing:

    To (un)subscribe any of the above lists, mail a note to the same
    address with -request appended to the list name with a subject
    line of "subscribe" or "unsubscribe".

    For example:   mailing a note to

          ucd-snmp-announce-request@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu

    with a subject line of "subscribe" will subscribe
    you to the announcement list.

AGENT EXTENSIBILITY

  The agent that comes with this package is extensible through use of
  shell scripts and other methods.  See the configuration manual pages
  (like snmpd.conf) and the EXAMPLE.conf file for details.

  You can also extend the agent by writing C code directly.  The agent
  is extremely modular in nature and you need only create new files,
  re-run configure and re-compile.  No modification of the distributed
  source files are necessary.  See the following files for details on
  how to go about this: AGENT.txt, agent/mibgroup/examples/example.c,
  and agent/mibgroup/examples/example.h.  Also, see the local/mib2c
  program and its README file for help in turning a textual mib
  description into a C code template.

  We now support AgentX for subagent extensibility.  The ucd-snmp
  agent can run as both a master agent and a subagent.  Additionally,
  a toolkit is provided that enables users of it to easily embed a
  agentx client into external applications.  See the tutorial at
  http://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu/tutorial/toolkit for an example of how
  go about doing this.

CONFIGURATION

  See the man/snmp.conf.5 manual page.

  For the agent, additionally see the man/snmpd.conf.5 manual page and
  the EXAMPLE.conf file mentioned above.

  For the snmptrapd, see the man/snmptrapd.conf.5 manual page.

EXAMPLE AGENT CONFIGURATION AND USAGE

  See the 'EXAMPLE.conf' file in the top level source directory (you
  must build the package for this file to be generated).

SUBMITTING BUG REPORTS

  Important: *Please* include what version of the ucd-snmp package you
  are using and what architecture(s) you're using, as well as detailed
  information about exactly what is wrong.

  To submit a bug report, ideally, you should use
  http://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu/ucd-snmp-bugs to enter your
  submissions.  It is a full-fledged bug-tracking system that will
  allow you to search for already existing bug reports as well as
  track the status of your report as it is processed by the core
  developers.

  Alternatively, submit your bug report to
  ucd-snmp-bugs@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu.  Both paths do end up at the
  same place in the bug tracking system, but the URL submissions are a 
  bit more complete in nature.

  Patches should be sent to the above email address as well.

  If you intend to submit a patch as well, please read the PORTING
  file before you do so.  Thanks!

CLOSING

  We love patches.  Send some to us!  But before you do, please see
  the 'PORTING' file for information on helping us out with the
  process of integrating your patches (regardless of whether its a new
  feature implementation or a new port).

  Also, We're interested if anyone actually uses/likes/hates/whatever
  this package...  Mail us a note and let us know what you think of it!

  Have fun and may it make your life easier,

    Wes Hardaker
    ucd-snmp-coders@ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu
