This sub-group of the UCD agent is a beta implementation
of the AgentX agent extensibility protocol, as described in
RFC2257, and extended in a current internet draft
	<draft-ietf-agentx-rfc-update-00.txt>	(June 1999)

  This is a reasonably full implementation, in as much as it 
supports all the protocol operations described in this document.
However, it has not really been extensively tested - either 
across the full range of architectures of the main agent, or 
in terms of interoperability with other AgentX implementations.

  Testing has basically concentrated on ensuring correct operation
between the UCD master and subagent code on the core development
system (a Linux box, running RedHat 5.2 with kernel 2.0.36).
It is quite likely that running this on other architectures,
or against other AgentX implementations, will reveal outstanding
problems, and it would be premature to rely on this release for a
production system.  Hopefully, experience gained with this code
should result in a production-capable status fairly quickly.

  Although the basic operations are all supported, there are a number
of areas that are known to be incomplete or missing.  These include:

	- Contexts
		The UCD agent does not currently handle
		non-default contexts at all.  The AgentX
		elements simply ignore the context field.

	- Repeated sub-agent failures
		If a GetNext request to a subagent fails to
		return an acceptable response, the request
		will then be passed on to the next MIB module.
		  If this also fails to respond successfully,
		then the agent may not keep trying correctly.

	- Timeouts
		The master agent does not currently handle
		tardy responses from a subagent.
		  The register of MIB regions does not record
		the associated timeouts.

	- GETNEXT ranges
		The end range of an AgentX GetNext request is
		not set correctly by the master agent, or
		interpreted by the subagent.

	- AgentX GETBULK
		The master agent will handle an SNMP GetBulk
		request using a sequence of AgentX GetNext calls.
		The subagent GetBulk handling _should_ work
		correctly, but this has not been tested.

	- AgentX MIB
		This has not yet been implemented.

	-  Multiple sessions on a single connection
		This should work, but has not been tested.


  While these areas will need to be fixed before this implementation
can be regarded as "finished", it was not felt worth delaying the
release of the latest version until they could be handled correctly.
  The state of the AgentX implementation should be sufficiently useable
for it to be worth releasing to a wider audience, in order to gather
feedback and useability reports.

  To configure AgentX support into the UCD agent, run configure with
the flag --with-mib-module="agentx", and compile the library and agent.
Copy (or link) the 'snmpd' binary (the main master agent) to 'agentxd',
which will run as a subagent.
  Note that the subagent will read the config file 'agentxd.conf' rather
than the usual 'snmpd.conf', though the syntax and contents of this file
work in precisely the same way.


  Please report any problems experienced to the ucd-snmp-coders list.
