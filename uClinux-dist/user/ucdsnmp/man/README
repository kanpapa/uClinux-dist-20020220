Some documentation updating has been done for version 2 of the release.  The
command line format has changed significantly from version 1.  Most commands
take a form similar to:

    Usage: snmpwalk -v 1 [-q] hostname community [objectID]      or:
    Usage: snmpwalk [-v 2] [-q] hostname noAuth [objectID]

All forms have generally been included in the documentation.
For unauthenticated version 1 or version 2 queries, you will most
likely want either:

	snmpwalk -v 1 hostname public ...
or:
	snmpwalk hostname noAuth ...
