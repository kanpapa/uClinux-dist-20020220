.SH NAME
snmpbulkget - communicates with a network entity using SNMP BULK Requests.
.SH SYNOPSIS
snmpbulkget [common arguments] [objectID]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
In addition to the common arguments,
.I snmpbulkget
takes one specific argument
.IP "-B <nonrep> <rep>"
where
.I nonrep
specifies the number of input variables that should not repeat, and
.I rep
is the maximum number of repetitions of the rest of the variables.
.PP
For example
.PP
.I snmpbulkwalk -v 2c -B 1 10 zeus public system interfaces
.PP
will retrieve the variable system.sysDescr.0 (which is the lexicographically
next object to system) and the first 10 objects of the interfaces group.
.PP
.I system.sysDescr.0
= "SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m"
.br
.I interfaces.ifNumber.0
= 2
.br
.I interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifIndex.1
= 1
.br
.I interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifIndex.2
= 2
.br
.I interfaces.ifTable.ifEntry.ifDescr.1
= "lo0"
.br
et cetera.
.PP
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an error
packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to pinpoint why
the request was malformed.
.PP
.SH NOTE
As the name implies, snmpbulkget utilizes the SNMP GETBULK message,
which is not available in SNMP v1.
.PP
.SH "SEE ALSO"
snmpcmd(1), variables(5).
