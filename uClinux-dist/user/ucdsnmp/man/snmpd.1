.SH NAME
snmpd - daemon to respond to SNMP request packets.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "snmpd [-v] [-a] [-V] [-d] [-q] [-D] [-p port] [-x agentx-socket] [-f] [-l logfile] [-L] [-c file] [-C] [-r]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B snmpd
is a SNMP agent which binds to a port and awaits requests from
SNMP management software.  Upon receiving a request, it processes the
request(s), collects the requested information and/or performs the
requested operation(s) and returns the information to the sender.
.SH OPTIONS
.RS
.TP 6
.B -v
Print version information for the agent, and exit.
.TP
.B -a
Dumps the addresses the agent corresponds with to stderr or logfile.
.TP
.B -V
Makes a symbolic dump of the protocol transaction.
.TP
.B -d
Dumps the sent and received UDP packets to stderr or logfile.
.TP 
.B -q
Print simpler output for easier automated parsing.
.TP
.B -D
Turn on debugging output
.TP
.B -p port
Opens on 
.I port
instead of the default SNMP agent port, 161.
.TP
.B -x agentx-socket
Listens for AgentX connections on the specified socket
rather than the default '/var/agentx/master'.
The socket can either be a Unix domain socket path,
or the address of a network interface.
If a network address of the form
.B inet-addr:port
is given, then the agent will listen on the port specified.
If a network address of the form
.B inet-addr
is given, then the agent will listen on the default AgentX port, 705.
.TP
.B -f
Don't fork() from the calling shell.
.TP
.B -l logfile
Log's all output from the agent (including stdout/stderr) to 
.I logfile.
Defaults to a compiled option.
.TP
.B -L
Don't open a log file; use stdout/stderr instead.
.TP
.B -A
Append to the log file rather than truncating it.
.TP
.B -c file
Read 
.I file
as a configuration file.
.TP
.B -C
Don't read any configuration files except the one optionally specified by the 
.B -c 
option.
.TP
.B -r
Don't require root access to run the demon.  Specifically, don't exit
when you can't open files like /dev/kmem, etc...

.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
.PP
.B snmpd
checks for the existence of and parses the following files:
.TP 6
.B /usr/local/share/snmp/snmp.conf
Common configuration for the agent and the application. See snmp.conf(5)
for details.
.TP
.B /usr/local/share/snmp/snmpd.conf
.TP
.B /usr/local/share/snmp/snmpd.local.conf
Configures the agent.  See snmpd.conf(5) for details.  These files are
optional and are only used to configure the extensible portions of the
agent, the values of the community strings, and the optional trap
destinations.  By default, the first community string ("public" by
default) is allowed read-only access and the second ("private" by
default) is allowed write access as well.  The 3-5th community strings
are read-only as well.
.IP
In addition to these two configuration files in /usr/local/share/snmp, the
agent will read any files with the names
.I snmpd.conf
and
.I snmpd.local.conf
in a colon separated path specified in the
SNMPCONFPATH environment variable.
.TP
.B /usr/local/share/snmp/mibs/
The agent will also load all files in this directory as mibs also.  It
will not, however, load any file that begins with a '.' or descend into
subdirectories.
