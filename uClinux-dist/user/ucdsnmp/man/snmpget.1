.SH NAME
snmpget - communicates with a network entity using SNMP GET Requests.
.SH SYNOPSIS
snmpget [-Cf] [ common arguments ] objectID [objectID]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Snmpget is an SNMP application that uses the GET Request to query for
information on a network entity.  One or more fully qualified object
identifiers may be given as arguments on the command line.
Each variable name is given in the format specified in
.IR variables (5).
.PP
For example
.PP
.I snmpget zeus public system.sysDescr.0
.PP
will retrieve the variable system.sysDescr.0:
.PP
.I system.sysDescr.0 =
"SunOS zeus.net.cmu.edu 4.1.3_U1 1 sun4m"
.PP
If the network entity has an error processing the request packet, an error
packet will be returned and a message will be shown, helping to pinpoint in what
way the request was malformed.  If there were other variables in the request,
the request will be resent without the bad variable.
.PP
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IP -Cf
If -Cf is not specified, some applications (E.G., snmpget,
snmpgetnext, snmpwalk, etc) will try to fix errors returned by the
agent that you were talking to and resend the request.  The only time
this is really useful is if you specified a OID that didn't exist in
your request and you're using SNMPv1 which requires "all or nothing"
kinds of requests. Example (system.sysUptime is an incomplete OID
request for agents as it needs the .0 index appended to it):
.nf
snmpget -v 1 -Cf localhost public system.sysUpTime system.sysContact.0
Error in packet
Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
This name doesn't exist: system.sysUpTime

snmpget -v 1 localhost public system.sysUpTime system.sysContact.0
Error in packet
Reason: (noSuchName) There is no such variable name in this MIB.
This name doesn't exist: system.sysUpTime

system.sysContact.0 = root@localhost
.fi
.IP
With the -Cf specified the application will not try to fix the PDU for 
you.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
snmpcmd(1), variables(5).
