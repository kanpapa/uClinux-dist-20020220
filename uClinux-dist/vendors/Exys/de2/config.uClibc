# Note that the kernel source you use to compile with should be the same as the

# compatibility across kernel versions.  So don't expect, for example, uClibc
# compiled with Linux kernel 2.0.x to implement lchown properly, since 2.0.x
# can't do that. Similarly, if you compile uClibc vs Linux 2.4.x kernel headers,
# but then run on Linux 2.0.x, lchown will be compiled into uClibc, but won't
# work at all.  You have been warned.

# support in libc (strtod, printf, scanf).  Set it to `true' otherwise.

# This specifies which malloc implementation is used.
# "malloc-simple" is very, very small, but is also very, very dumb 
# and does not try to make good use of memory or clean up after itself.
#
# "malloc" on the other hand is a bit bigger, but is pretty smart thereby
# minimizing memory wastage and reusing already allocated memory.  This 
# can be lots faster and safer IMHO.
#
# "malloc-930716" is from libc-5.3.12 and was/is the standard gnu malloc.
# It is actually smaller than "malloc", at least on i386.  Right now, it
# only works on i386 (and maybe m68k) because it needs sbrk.

# If you want to collect common syscall code into one function, set to this to

# The idea came from the implementation in dietlibc.
# At present, only affects i386.

# ROOT_DIR is the base directory which will be compiled into the uClibc 
# runtime environment.  When compiled as a shared library, the shared
# library loader will look in <ROOT_DIR>/lib and <ROOT_DIR>/usr/lib
# for shared libraries.
#
# DEVEL_PREFIX is the base directory which will be compiled into the uClibc 
# development environment.  The uClibc development environment will
# look for the uClibc header files under <DEVEL_PREFIX><ROOT_DIR>/usr/include,
# and for static libs and crt0.o in <DEVEL_PREFIX><ROOT_DIR>/usr/lib.
# Also, 'make install' will install the compiler tools to 
# <DEVEL_PREFIX><ROOT_DIR>/bin and <DEVEL_PREFIX><ROOT_DIR>/usr/bin.
#
# TARGET_PREFIX is the directory under which 'make install' will install the 
# uClibc runtime environment.   This path does not get compiled into anything,
# and is provided simply to make it easier to build standalone target systems.
# Note: This doesn't do anything if there are no shared libs.
